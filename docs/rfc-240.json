I\nam sorry for any embarrassment this may have caused to anyone associated\nwith the Network, and accept full responsibility for the content of RFC\n#235.  I will try to do a better job in the future.\n\n\nAlex McKenzie\n\n\n                              SITE STATUS\n\n\n     Beginning with this RFC, BBN will report on the status of\nmost Network Hosts approximately once every two weeks.  The information\nfor these reports will be gained from talking to people at each site,\nand from experimental \"data\".  These data will be the results of daily\nattempts to log into each of the Hosts which might be accessible to a\nNetwork user; the attempts will have been made from the BBN prototype\nTerminal IMP at a random time each weekday.\n\n     Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.\nThese Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n     1)   Hosts which are note expected to be functioning on the\n          Network as servers (available for use from other sites) for at\n          least a month.  Included here are:\n\n               Network        Site      Computer\n               Address\n\n                 71           Rand      PDP-10\n                 74           Lincoln   TX2\n                 11           Stanford  PDP-10\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC #240\n\n\n                 13           Case      PDP-10\n                 14           Carnegie  PDP-10\n                 15           Paoli     B6500\n\n     2)   Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.\n          Included here are the Terminal IMPs presently in the Network\n          (AMES, MITRE, and BBN[1]).  This category also includes the\n          Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is\n          use solely for gathering statistics from the Network.\n          Finally, included among these Hosts are the following:\n\n               Network        Site      Computer\n               Address\n\n                  7           Rand      IBM-360/65\n                 73           Harvard   PDP-1\n                 12           Illinois  PDP-11\n\n     The tables on the next two pages condense the information on\nHost status for September 13 through September 24.\n\n                                                        PREDICTIONS\nNETWORK SITE         COMPUTER   STATUS or PREDICTION    OBTAINED\nADDRESS                                                 FROM\n\n 1      UCLA         SIGMA - 7  Server                  Jon Postel\n65      UCLA         IBM-360/91 Remote Job Service now,\n                                Time-sharing in January Steve Wolf\n 2      SRI(NIC)     PDP-10     October 11              John Melvin\n66      SRI(AI)      PDP-10     November                Len Chaiten\n 3      UCSB         IBM-360-75 Server                  Jim White\n 4      UTAH         PDP-10     \"Soon\"                  Barry Wessler\n 5      BBN          DDP-516    NCC                     Alex McKenzie\n69      BBN          PDP-10     Server                  Dan Murphy\n 6      MIT(Multics) H-645      \"Soon\"                  Mike Padlipsky\n70      MIT(DM)      PDP-10     Server                  Bob Bressler\n 7      RAND         IBM 360/65 User only               Eric Harslem\n71      RAND         PDP-10     January                 Eric Harslem\n 8      SDC          IBM-360/67 October 11              Bob Long\n 9      HARVARD      PDP-10     \"Soon\"                  Bob Sundberg\n73      HARVARD      PDP-1      User only               Bob Sundberg\n10      LINCOLN      IBM-360/67 \"Soon\"                  Joel Winnet\n74      LINCOLN      TX2        Uncertain               Tom Barkalow\n11      STANFORD     PDP-10     November                Andy Moorer\n12      ILLINOIS     PDP-11     User only               John Cravits\n13      CASE         PDP-10     December 15             Charles Rose\n14      CARNEGIE     PDP-10     January                 Hal VanZoeren\n15      PAOLI        B6500      Uncertain               John Cravits\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC #240\n\n\n16      AMES         TIP        Installed\n17      MITRE        TIP        Installed\n30      BBN          TIP        Prototype\n\n\nNETWORK   SITE      COMPUTER                DATE AND TIME (P.M.)\nADDRESS                         9/13  9/14  9/15  9/16  9/17  9/20\n                                4:30  3:30  6:00  10:30 1:30  12:30\n 1        UCLA      SIGMA-7      O     O     O     D     D     D\n65[2]     UCLA      IBM 360/91   O     O     O     O     O     D\n 2        SRI(NIC)  PDP-10       D     D     D     D     D     D\n66        SRI(AI)   PDP-10       D     D     D     D     D     D\n 3        UCSB      IBM-360/75   O     O     O     O     O     O\n 4        UTAH      PDP-10       D     D     D     D     D     D\n69        BBN       PDP-10       O   1/2 0   O     T   1/2 O   O\n 6        MIT(Multics) H-645     R     R     R     D   1/2 O   D\n70        MIT(DM)   PDP-10       T     T     T     O     O     T\n 8        SDC       IBM-360/67   D     D     D     D     T     D\n 9        HARVARD   PDP-10       T     D     T     T     T     T\n10        LINCOLN   IBM-360/67   D   1/2 0 1/2 0   D     T     D\n\n\nNETWORK   SITE      COMPUTER     DATE AND TIME (P.M.)\nADDRESS                         9/21  9/22  9/23  9/24\n                                4:30  3:30  2:00  5:00\n\n 1        UCLA      SIGMA-7      O     D     T     O\n65[2]     UCLA      IBM 360/91   O     O     O     O\n 2        SRI(NIC)  PDP-10       D     O     D     D\n66        SRI(AI)   PDP-10       D     D     D     D\n 3        UCSB      IBM-360/75   O     O     O     O\n 4        UTAH      PDP-10       D     D     D     D\n69        BBN       PDP-10       O   1/2 O   O     O\n 6        MIT(Multics) H-645   1/2 O   T     T     R\n70        MIT(DM)   PDP-10     1/2 O   O     D     D\n 8        SDC       IBM-360/67   D     D     D     D\n 9        HARVARD   PDP-10       D     T     D     D\n10        LINCOLN   IBM-360/67   D     D   1/2 0   D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC #240\n\n\nwhere\n  D = Dead.
