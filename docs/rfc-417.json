This is a violation of the official HOST-HOST\n   protocol.  This causes problems with some sites when attempting to\n   establish connections with TENEX systems.  We urge that this problem\n   be corrected by bringing all TENEX systems into conformance with the\n   established official protocol\n\n\n          [This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry]\n      [into the online RFC archives by Helene Morin, Via Genie 12/99]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostel \u0026 Kline                                                  [Page 1]\n\f\n"
