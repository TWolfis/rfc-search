These primitives are at the level of system calls: SPOP's or\n   BRS's on the 940; UUO's on the PDP-10.  Presumably these UUO's are\n   accessible to all user programs when executing for users whose status\n   bits allow network access.\n\n   In addition to user program access, a convenient means for direct\n   network access from the terminal is desirable.  A sub-system called\n   \"Telnet\" is proposed which is a shell program around the network\n   system primitives, allowing a teletype or similar terminal at a\n   remote host to function as a teletype at the serving host.\n\nSystem Primitives\n\n   G. Deloche of U.C.L.A. has documented a proposed set of basic network\n   primitives for inclusion in the operating systems of the respective\n   HOSTs (NWG Note:  11).  The primitives are:\n\n      Open primary connection\n\n      Open auxiliary connection\n\n      Transmit over connection\n\n      Close connection.\n\n   The details  and terminology are defined by Deloche and others in\n   previous memos.  The primitives are system calls, available to\n   programmers, and are most likely a part of the resident monitor,\n   rather than the swappable executive.\n\nBasic Terminal Access\n\n   In addition to user programming access, it is desirable to have a\n   subsystem program at each HOST which makes the network immediately\n   accessible from the teletype without special programming.  Subsystems\n   are commonly used system components such as text editors, compilers\n   and interpreters.  The first network-related subsystem should allow\n\n\n\nCarr                                                            [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 15          Network Subsystem for Time Sharing Hosts  September 1969\n\n\n   users at HOST A to connect to HOST B and appear as a regular terminal\n   user to HOST B.
