Murray\nRequest for Comments: 420                Computer Corporation of America\nNIC 12764                                                04 January 1973\n\n\n                         CCA ICCC WEATHER DEMO\n\n   THE WEATHER DEMO ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED FOR THE ICCC SHOW IS NOW\n   GENERALLY AVAILABLE.  IT IS A VERY NICE NETWORK DEMO SINCE IT REALLY\n   CAN/DOES RUN ON TWO MACHINES.\n\n   THIS DEMO IS TWO INDEPENDENT PROGRAMS.  TOGETHER THEY TRY TO ANSWER\n   ENGLISH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WEATHER.  FOR EXAMPLE, 'DID IT RAIN IN\n   BOSTON ON OCTOBER 7?'.  THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROGRAM IS WRITTEN IN\n   LISP.  IT IS A MODIFICATION OF A SYSTEM DEVELOPED BY T.  WINOGRAD AT\n   MIT.  THE OTHER HALF IS A PRIMITIVE DATACOMPUTER.  THE DATACOMPUTER\n   PROVIDES NETWORK DATAMANAGEMENT FACILITIES AND WILL INCORPORATE THE\n   TRILLION-BIT UNICON CURRENTLY BEING INSTALLED AT AMES.\n\n   THE TWO PROGRAMS COMMUNICATE VIA DATALANGUAGE USING THE NET.\n\n   'WEATHER' NOW USES HOST '37' AS THE LOCATION OF THE DATACOMPUTER.\n   THIS FIXES THE OLD 'CCA' NOT IN THE HOST TABLES BUG.\n\n   KEEP IN MIND THAT IS AN EVOLVING SYSTEM, WE PLAN TO IMPROVE 'WEATHER'\n   AND THE DATACOMPUTER THAT IT USES, SO THINGS THAT WORK ONE DAY MAY\n   GET BROKEN THE NEXT.\n\nAVAILABILITY\n\n   'WEATHER' (THE LISP HALF) IS A REAL MACHINE USER - BOTH CPU AND CORE.\n   WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY PREFER THAT YOU RUN IT ON YOUR MACHINE.  IF WE ARE\n   REALLY EMPTY (WHICH FREQUENTLY HAPPENS AT 3 AM) FEEL FREE TO RUN IT\n   ON OUR MACHINE.  SINCE OUR SYSTEM HAS NO DRUM, AND WEATHER TAKES ALL\n   OF CORE, PLEASE CHECK WITH SOMEBODY AT CCA BEFORE RUNNING WEATHER IF\n   WE ARE DOING ANYTHING AT ALL.  IT IS REALLY A MAJOR LOAD ON OUR\n   MACHINE.\n\n   SINCE THE DATACOMPUTER IS LESS OF A LOAD, THE SYSTEM WILL BE MORE\n   AVAILABLE IF YOU CAN RUN 'WEATHER' ON YOUR MACHINE.  WE WILL TRY TO\n   RUN THE DATACOMPUTER DURING NON-PRIME TIME.  IT CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS\n   THE SERVER HALF OF THIS COMBINATION.  PRIME TIME HERE IS 1 TO 5 PM\n   EASTERN TIME, BUT THE MORNING IS FREQUENTLY QUITE BUSY TOO.  PLEASE\n   DO NOT USE THE DATACOMPUTER DURING THIS TIME.  IT WILL SAVE US THE\n   EFFORT OF TURNING IT OFF.  CURRENTLY, ONLY ONE USER AT A TIME CAN RUN\n   - A LIMITATION OF THE DATACOMPUTER THAT WILL GO AWAY SOMEDAY.\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray                                                          [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 420                  CCA ICCC Weather Demo              January 1973\n\n\n   IF YOU WANT TO RUN A DEMO (NOT JUST PLAY AROUND) WE WILL PROBABLY BE\n   ABLE TO COOPERATE.  PLEASE CALL TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS WELL IN ADVANCE.\n   WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT TRY TO GIVE AN IMPORTANT DEMO\n   UNLESS YOU HAVE USED BOTH VERSIONS OF THE SYSTEMS THAT WILL BE USED\n   FOR THE DEMO.  EVEN WE GET IN TROUBLE WHEN WE FORGET TO REHEARSE\n   THINGS A BIT.\n\n   WEDNESDAY MORNING IS SCHEDULED PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE TIME.  OUR\n   MACHINE WILL NOT BE UP BETWWEN 9 AND 12, BUT IT FREQUENTLY IS DOWN\n   PAST NOON.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\n   FOR THE LATEST INFORMATION, LOOK AT *.TXT IN \u003cWDB-DEMO\u003e AT CCA.  IN\n   PARTICULAR, MESSAGE.TXT SHOULD BE A QUICK SUMMARY OF ANY OTHER\n   INTERESTING TXT FILES.  THE LATEST VERSION OF THIS FILE (IN RUNOFF\n   FORMAT) IS \u003cHGM-MEMOS\u003eANNOUNCE.RNO.\n\n   THE LATEST VERSION OF THE LISP PROGRAM WILL BE IN \u003cWDB-DEMO\u003e AS\n   WEATHER.SAV. NORMAL FTP CAN BE USED TO COPY IT - IT IS 400+ PAGES.\n   IT TAKES 6 MIN TO TRANSFER IT TO OURSELVES (1.5 MIN OF CPU, 22KBAUD)\n   WHEN THE MACHINE IS VERY LIGHLY LOADED.  BE SURE TO SET THE BYTE SIZE\n   TO 36 ('TENEX' COMMAND TO FTP) SINCE THIS IS A SAVE FILE.\n\nPROBLEMS\n\n   IF YOU FIND ANY PROBLEMS WITH LISP HALF, PLEASE USE SNDMSG TO SEND\n   THINGS TO JEFF HILL - HE IS JMH@CCA.  WE ARE INTERESTED IN EXAMPLES\n   WHICH LOOK LIKE THEY SHOULD WORK BUT DON'T.  IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS\n   ABOUT GENERAL OPERATIONS GLITCHES - LIKE THE DATACOMPUTER IS NOT UP -\n   BITCH TO ME - HGM@CCA.  CCA IS HOST 31 DECIMAL, 37 OCTAL.\n\nUSING THE SYSTEM\n\n   AFTER STARTING WEATHER, THE SYSTEM WILL INITIALIZE ITSELF, TYPE OUT\n   SOME MESSAGES, AND ASK FOR THE JULIAN DATE (REALLY THE DAY NUMBER OF\n   THE YEAR OF 'TODAY').  300 IS THE BEST ANSWER.  THAT MAKES 'TODAY' BE\n   OCT 26, THE LAST DAY OF THE ICCC DEMO, AND ONE DAY PAST THE LATEST\n   DATA.  IF YOU TYPE SOME OTHER NUMBER, 'YESTERDAY', AND 'LAST WEEK'\n   WON'T WORK AS WELL.  THE SYSTEM PROMPTS WITH 'READY' WHEN IT IS READY\n   TO ACCEPT A SENTENCE.  BE SURE TO END THE SENTENCE WITH THE PROPER\n   PUNCTUATION.  SENTENCES MAY BE EDITED WITH:\n\n      ^A (CONTROL A) -- DELETES LAST CHARACTER OR WORD TYPED\n\n      ^R (CONTROL R) -- RETYPES SENTENCE SO FAR\n\n      ^Q (CONTROL Q) -- DELETES ENTIRE SENTENCE\n\n\n\nMurray                                                          [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 420                  CCA ICCC Weather Demo              January 1973\n\n\n      ^X (CONTROL X) -- SAME AS CONTROL Q\n\n   IN ADDITION, TWO CONTROL CHARACTERS CAN BE USED DURING THE PROCESSING\n   OF SENTENCES, ^E (CONTROL E) ABORTS THE PROCESSING OF THE SENTENCE\n   AND RETURNS TO THE READY STATE.  ^D (CONTROL D) ABORTS THE WHOLE\n   SYSTEM, AND CAUSES IT TO RE-INITIALIZE ITSELF.\n\n   DURING SENTENCE INPUT, THE SYSTEM ATTEMPTS TO LOOK UP EACH WORD AS IT\n   IS TYPED, AND DO SPELLING CORRECTION.  HOWEVER, SINCE THE NAMES OF\n   ALL THE CITIES ARE KEPT AT THE DATACOMPUTER, THE SYSTEM ACCEPTS ALL\n   UNKNOWN WORDS AS POSSIBLE PLACE NAMES TO BE CHECKED LATER ON IN THE\n   PROCESSING.  IF THE SPELLING CORRECTOR CORRECTS ONE OF YOUR CITY\n   NAMES TO A VOCABULARY WORD, YOU CAN ERASE THE WORD AND RETYPE IT\n   PRECEEDED BY AN EQUAL SIGN (=).  THIS FORCES THE SYSTEM TO ACCEPT THE\n   WORD AS A PROPER NOUN.\n\n   THE SYSTEM RETURNS TO THE READY STATE AFTER ANSWERING THE QUESTION.\n   TO TERMINATE A SESSION YOU MAY TYPE 'GOODBYE.', WHICH WILL LEAVE YOU\n   BACK AT THE TENEX COMMAND LEVEL.\n\n   IF THE SYSTEM CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOUR REQUEST, IT TRIES TO GIVE YOU\n   SOME EXPLANATORY MESSAGE.  HOWEVER, IT'S NOT VERY GOOD AT EXPLAINING\n   ITS BEHAVIOR SO YOU WILL USUALLY GET THE DEFAULT MESSAGE 'SORRY, I\n   COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT REQUEST.' IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHY,\n   SEND US A TRANSCRIPTIPT OF YOUR SESSION.\n\nRESTRICTIONS - HINTS\n\n   THE SYSTEM IS NOT LINGUISTICALLY SOPHISTICATED.  IT PERFORMS PASSABLY\n   ON SENTENCES WHICH WOULD BE CONSIDERED SIMPLE REQUESTS FOR\n   INFORMATION.  IT DOES NOT REALLY UNDERSTAND THE 'WEATHER', RATHER IT\n   UNDERSTANDS HOW TO COMPOSE RETRIEVAL REQUESTS FOR WEATHER DATA IN ITS\n   DATA BASE.\n\n   A LARGE SET OF EXAMPLE SENTENCES CAN BE FOUND IN \u003cWDB-\n   DEMO\u003eSENTENCES.TXT.  THOSE SENTENCES PRECEDE BY A BACKSLASH (\\) DO\n   NOT WORK.  AN EXPLANATORY COMMENT, PRECEEDED BY A SEMI-COLON (;),\n   EXPLAINS THE REASONS FOR FAILURE.  SOME OF THE OTHERS MAY NOT WORK\n   EITHER.\n\n   THE MAJOR THINGS THAT WE KNOW DON'T WORK ARE:\n\n      1. CONJUNCTION\n\n      2. NEGATION\n\n      3. COMPLEX QUANTIFICATION\n\n\n\n\nMurray                                                          [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC 420                  CCA ICCC Weather Demo              January 1973\n\n\n      4. SOPHISTICATED PRONOUN REFERENCE\n\n      5. QUESTIONS NOT (!!) INVOLVING WEATHER,E.G.,\n\n         'WHAT DAY WAS YESTERDAY?'\n\n         'WHAT CITIES ARE IN MASSACHUSETTS?'\n\n   'IT' IS NOT WORKING TOO WELL THESE DAYS.  IF YOU GET IN TROUBLE, TRY\n   SOMETHING WITHOU 'IT' THAT IS KNOWN TO WORK.  'WHAT WAS THE\n   TEMPERATURE IN BOSTON YESTERDAY?' IS BETTER THAN MOST - WE ARE QUITE\n   APT TO TEST THAT PHRASE.\n\n   THE SYSTEM DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT THE WORD 'SNOW'.  THERE IS NO WAY TO\n   LIST ITS VOCABULARY.  HOWEVER, THE SENTENCES IN SENTENCES.TXT SHOULD\n   GIVE YOU A GOOD IDEA OF THE WORDS THE SYSTEM UNDESTANDS.\n\n   THE AVERAGE TIME FOR UNDERSTANDING AND ANSWERING A QUESTION IS ABOUT\n   1 MINUTE.  IF THE SYSTEM TAKES MUCH LONGER THAN THIS YOU SHOULD GET\n   SUSPICIOUS.  IF YOU ASK A VERY BIG QUESTION, LIKE 'WHAT WAS THE\n   HOTTEST PLACE IN CANADA?', THE LISP SYSTEM MAY GO INTO A GC (GARBAGE\n   COLLENTION) LOOP.  RESTARTING ALL OVER (WITH ^D) WILL BE OK, BUT THE\n   DATACOMPUTER MAY TAKE A LONG TIME TO RECOVER - IT DOESN'T (YET)\n   NOTICE THAT ANYTHING HAS GONE WRONG UNTIL IT ASKS FOR MORE INPUT.\n\nDATA\n\n   THE DATA FROM OCT 1 THRU 16 IS ALMOST COMPLETE.  BETWEEN OCT 17 TO 25\n   IT IS FREQUENTLY SKETCHY.  WE PLAN TO RELOAD EVERYTHING SOMETIME\n   USING SEPTEMBER'S DATA, SO WE WILL HAVE A COMPLETE MONTH OF CLEAN\n   DATA.  NOTE: THIS DATA HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY SUMMARIZED - IT IS\n   PROBABLY NOT USEFUL FOR PEOPLE INTERESTED IN WEATHER.\n\n   THE OCTOBER DATA IS ABOUT 2400 PAGES OF REAL DATA, PLUS ABOUT 200\n   MORE FOR THE INVERSION.  THERE ARE ABOUT 4000 CITIES.  THE CITY NAMES\n   HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO THE LOCAL CITY WHENEVER POSSIBLE.  I.E. 'BOSTON'\n   IS 'BOSTON' NOT 'LOGAN'.\n\n   'ALASKA' GOT LOST SOMEHOW.  DON'T BOTHER ASKING FOR IT.\n\nSAMPLE DATALANGUAGE\n\n   THESE EXAMPLES ON THIS AND THE FOLLOWING PAGES WORK ON A VERY OLD\n   VERSION OF THE DATACOMPUTER.  THEY ARE NOT THE FINAL FORM OF\n   DATALANGUAGE THAT SHOULD BA AVAILABLE SOON.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurray                                                          [Page 4]\n\f\nRFC 420                  CCA ICCC Weather Demo              January 1973\n\n\n   THE FOLLOWING QUESTION TO 'WEATHER' GENERATED TWO REQUESTS TO THE\n   DATACOMPUTER.  THE FIRST USES THE CHECK PORT TO VERIFY THAT 'BOSTON'\n   IS A VALID CITY NAME, AND THE SECOND USES THE ANSWER PORT TO RETRIEVE\n   THE DATA.  THE ACTUAL REQUESTS THAT ARE SENT TO THE DATACOMPUTER DO\n   NOT HAVE THE CARRIAGE RETURNS THAT MAKE THEM READABLE - THEY ARE SENT\n   AS ONE VERY LONG LINE.
