Included here are the\nTerminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE, RADC,\nNBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, NOAA, SAAC, ARPA, and BBN*).  This category also\nincludes the Network Control Center computer (Network address 5) which\nis used solely for gathering statistics from the Network. Finally,\nincluded among these Hosts are the following:\n\n       Network\n       Address               Site               Computer\n       -------               ----               --------\n\n           7                 Rand               IBM-360/65\n          73                 Harvard            PDP-1\n         138                 Lincoln            TSP\n          12                 Illinois           PDP-11\n          19                 NBS                PDP-11\n          23                 USC                IBM-360/44\n\n     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status\nfor this period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________\n*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and\nas such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being\nused to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nSTATUS OR\n SITE                                                        PREDICTIONS\nADDRESS  SITE           COMPUTER      STATUS OR PREDICTION   OBTAINED FROM\n-------  ----           --------      --------------------   -------------\n   1     UCLA           SIGMA-7       SERVER #Limited        Jon Postel\n  65     UCLA           IBM-360/91    NETRJS now             Bob Braden\n                                        (Telnet in June)\n   2     SRI (NIC)      PDP-10        Server                 Jim White\n  66     SRI-AI                       Server                 Len Chaiten\n   3     UCSB           IBM-360/75    Server                 Ron Stoughton\n   4     UTAH           PDP-10        Server                 Barry Wessler\n  *5     BBN (NCC)      DDP-516       Never                  Alex McKenzie\n  69     BBN (TENEX-A)  PDP-10        Server                 Dan Murphy\n 133     BBN (TENEX-B)  PDP-10        Server (Exper.)
