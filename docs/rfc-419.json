The best estimate\n   I have, at present, is that we expect that on or about December 26,\n   1972, the system will cease operation for a period of at least 10\n   days and possibly as long as three weeks.  During this period, we\n   will be installing a paging system.  I wish to advise people of this\n   hiatus in system operation and also to advise them that during the\n   first few weeks the paging system is in operation, the Dynamic\n   Modeling system may not be as available as it has been in the past.\n\n\n          [This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry]\n      [into the online RFC archives by Helene Morin, Via Genie 12/99]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVezza                                                           [Page 1]\n\f\n"
