The dates are to be Nov. 29, 30.\n\n   We particularly would like this course to be for Station\n   Agents or Secretaries who could help others at a site use the\n   NIC and could transcribe documents or messages into NLS.\n   Anyone is welcome, however.  The only restriction is a limit\n   of 12 people.\n\n   Those desiring to attend should contact Dirk Van Nouhuys or\n   Dick Watson at (415) 326-6200 ext. 3370 or 2013.\n\n   We will be glad to make motel reservations for anyone\n   attending.  We usually use the Mermaid Motel in Menlo Park.\n\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
