During this interval the IBM 360/44 at the University\nof Southern California (Network Address 23) was connected to the\nNetwork; also, a Terminal IMP was installed in Omaha, Nebraska at\nGlobal Weather Central (Network Address 152) on April 18.\n\n     Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.\nThese Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as\nservers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis for at\nleast two weeks.  Included here are:\n         Network\n         Address              Site                Computer\n         -------              ----                --------\n           134               MIT-AI               PDP-10\n            13               Case                 PDP-10\n\n2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included here\nare the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES,\nMITRE, NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, and BBN*).  This category also includes\nthe Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is used\nsolely for gathering statistics from the Network.  Finally, included\namong these Hosts are the following:\n         Network\n         Address              Site                Computer\n         -------              ----                --------\n             7               Rand                 IBM-360/65\n            73               Harvard              PDP-1\n            12               Illinois             PDP-11\n            19               NBS                  PDP-11\n            23               USC                  IBM-360/44\n\n     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for\nthis period.\n________________\n*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as such\nis frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to refine\nand debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n                                                             \"STATUS OR\n SITE                                                        PREDICTIONS\"\nADDRESS  SITE         COMPUTER      STATUS OR PREDICTION     OBTAINED FROM\n-------  ----         --------      --------------------     -------------\n\n   1     UCLA         SIGMA-7       Server # Limited         Jon Postel\n  65     UCLA         IBM-360/91    NETRJS now               Bob Braden\n                                    (Telnet in April)\n   2     SRI(NIC)     PDP-10        Server                   John Melvin\n  66     SRI(AI)      PDP-10        Server                   Len Chaiten\n   3     UCSB         IBM-360/75    Server                   Jim White\n   4     UTAH         PDP-10        Server                   Barry Wessler\n  *5     BBN(NCC)     DDP-516       Never                    Alex McKenzie\n  69     BBN(TENEXA)  PDP-10        Server                   Dan Murphy\n 133     BBN(TENEXB)  PDP-10        Server (Exper.)
