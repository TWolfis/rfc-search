No testing was done on May 31 and June 1 due to an\n   attempt to install the new IMP system.\n\n   Three new terminal IMPs were installed during this interval.  On June\n   1, Terminal IMP #155 was installed at Fort Belvoir in Fairfax,\n   Virginia; on June 3, Terminal IMP #154 was installed at SAAC (Seismic\n   Array Analysis Center) in Alexandria, Virginia; and on June 5,\n   Terminal IMP #153 was installed at NOAA (National Oceanic Analysis\n   Agency) in Boulder, Colorado.\n\n   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These\n   Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n    1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as\n       servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis\n       for at least two weeks.  The only Host in this category is the\n       PDP-10 at Case (Network address 13).\n\n      2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included\n       here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network\n       (AMES, MITRE, NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, NOAA, SAAC, BELVOIR, and\n       BBN*).  This category also includes the Network Control Center\n\n\n\n\n\n   ___________\n   *The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\n   such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used\n   to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestheimer                                                      [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 353                   NETWORK HOST STATUS                  June 1972\n\n\n   computer (Network address 5) which is used solely for gathering\n   statistics from the Network.
