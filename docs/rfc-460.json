We would appreciate a reply\n   to this RFC from all sites within two weeks.  One convenient way to\n   reply is to make a copy of this RFC at the NIC and insert the replies\n   at the appropriate spots.  The results of this survey will be\n   published.  Please send replies to nic ident CSK or to\n\n   Charles Kline\n   Boelter Hall 3804\n   UCLA\n   405 Hilgard Ave.\n   Los Angeles, Cal. 90034\n\n   2 This particular RFC will deal with implementations of Network\n   Control Programs (NCPs).  Future RFCs will deal with .\n   implementations of Telnet, RJE, etc.\n\n   3 In order to ask questions about NCPs and get meaningful replies, I\n   will here describe what I consider to be my concept of an NCP.\n\n      3a An NCP is that part of the system which performs the tasks\n      necessary for host to host protocol as specified by document NIC\n      7104 (protocols notebook).\n\n      3b NCPs contain the following parts (though not necessarily as\n      separate pieces):\n\n         3b1 Code which handles connection establishment including\n         maintenance of the rendezvous table (table of open and pending\n         connections).\n\n         3b2 Code which handles transmission over open connections\n         including buffer management and the sending of allocate and\n         giveback commands.\n\n         3b3 Code which handles the actual movement of messages in and\n         out of the Imp (sometimes called the Imp handler and sometimes\n         in a separate cpu).\n\n         3b4 Other code including measurements, initialization, etc.\n\n\n\n\nKline                                                           [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 460                        NCP Survey                  February 1973\n\n\n   4. Please answer the following questions.  It is probably appropriate\n   to give this survey to the coder of the NCP or other knowledgeable\n   person.  Write na (not applicable) where it is appropriate.  Circle\n   the number of the appropriate choice when a choice is required.\n   Thank you.\n\n   5 General Information\n\n      5a Host Name: ----\n\n      5b Site Number: ----\n\n      5c Your name ----\n\n      5d Main cpu is a ---- (360/75, PDP-10, B6700, etc.)\n\n      5e Operating system in main cpu is ---- (tenex, os/360, etc.)\n\n      5f Is documentation available on your NCP?\n\n         5f1 user level (how to use NCP)\n\n         5f2 system level (implementation)\n\n         5f3 Is the documentation available at the NIC?\n\n   6 Imp interface\n\n      6a built:\n\n         6a1 in house\n\n         6a2 contracted to ----\n\n      6b full or half duplex?\n\n      6c maximum bandwidth is ---- baud in each direction\n\n   7 Coding of NCP\n\n      7a ncp was written:\n\n         7a1 in house\n\n            7a1a written in ---- man-months\n\n            7a1b Name of person who wrote NCP ----\n\n\n\n\nKline                                                           [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 460                        NCP Survey                  February 1973\n\n\n            7a1c debugged in ---- man-weeks\n\n            7a1d machine hours used in development and debugging of NCP\n            ----\n\n         7a2 contracted to ----\n\n            7a2a contractor took ---- man-months\n\n         7a3 supplied another site without modification by this site\n         (specify site where NCP obtained from ------).\n\n         7a4 supplied from another site but modified by this site for\n         different system or for other reasons (specify site where NCP\n         obtained from ------)\n\n            7a4a modifications took ---- man-weeks\n\n      7b NCP is maintained:\n\n         7b1 in house (person's name ----)\n\n         7b2 by another site (specify site ----)\n\n      7c Size of NCP code:\n\n         7c1 Total size of all NCP code (not tables or buffers) as\n         described above\n\n            7c1a ---- words of ---- bits per word\n\n         7c2 size of code which initializes NCP (on system up or after\n         NCP or NET crash)\n\n            7c2a ---- words of ---- bits per word\n\n         7c3 size of code which handles opening and closing of\n         connections\n\n            7c3a ---- words of ---- bits per word\n\n         7c4 size of code which moves data from user process to Imp\n         handler or from Imp handler to user process\n\n            7c4a ---- words of ---- bits per word\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKline                                                           [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC 460                        NCP Survey                  February 1973\n\n\n         7c5 size of Imp handler code\n\n            7c5a ---- words of ---- bits per word\n\n         7c6 size of other code (explain what it is)\n\n            7c6a ---- words of ---- bits per word\n\n      7d Size of NCP tables:\n\n         7d1 size of tables indexed by open connection (i.e. tables for\n         control of open connections)\n\n            7d1a ---- entries or ---- words per entry of ---- bits per\n            word\n\n         7d2 size of tables indexed by link (i.e. tables for link\n         management and for quick association of an input message with a\n         process)\n\n            7d2a ---- entries of ---- words per entry of ---- bits per\n            word\n\n         7d3 size of other tables (explain)\n\n            7d3a ---- entries of ---- words per entry of ---- bits per\n            word\n\n   8 Host-Imp communications\n\n      8a Imp handling is performed in\n\n         8a1 main cpu\n\n         8a2 additional processor (specify machine ----)\n\n      8b Imp handling is performed at:\n\n         8b1 interrupt level by resident code\n\n         8b2 scheduled process with resident code\n\n         8b3 scheduled process with swappable code\n\n      8c Number and size of buffers for the Imp handler (on input,\n      number of buffers for messages before cpu will stop taking bits\n      from imp.
