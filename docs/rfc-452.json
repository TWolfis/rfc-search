Winett\nRequest for Comments: 452                                            JMW\nNIC: 14136                                               8 February 1973\n\n\n                       TELNET Command at Host LL\n\n   The attached writeup documents the use of the TELNET command at Host\n   LL for uses under the CP/CMS time-sharing system.  This command\n   provides for use in a HALF DUPLEX or FULL DUPLEX mode and can be used\n   with ASCII codes or with EBCDIC codes (i.e., transparent mode).  The\n   keyboard conventions allow for entering all ASCII codes using a\n   CONTROL character followed by another character for the codes not\n   present on an IBM 2741 terminal.  In addition a number of local\n   TELNET control commands have been defined which allows the mode of\n   operation to be changed, the redefinition of special characters, the\n   sending of TELNET control codes, as well as for obtaining input from\n   a file instead of from the terminal.  These later features provide\n   for a rudimentary file transfer facility.\n\n   This material has not been reviewed for public release and is\n   intended only for use with the ARPA network.  It should not be quoted\n   or cited in any publication not related to the ARPA network.\n\n   TELNET\n\n   Purpose:\n\n      To access another terminal oriented system on the ARPA network.\n\n   Format:\n\n      TELNET host \u003ctag\u003e RESUME     EBCDIC      HALFDUP\n                    1    OPEN       ASCII      FULLDUP\n\n      host - either the hexadecimal code for a foreign network service\n              site or a standard mnemonic for a foreign site.  See\n              Figure 1.\n\n      tag - the identifier for the local connections to the network.\n              The tag is used together with the address of the virtual\n              machine descriptor table (UTABLE) to form local socket\n              numbers which are used in the network protocol.\n\n      RESUME - used to reactivate communications with a foreign site\n              after having previously left the TELNET command leaving\n              the connections open.\n\n\n\n\nWinett                                                          [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 452                TELNET Command at Host LL           February 1973\n\n\n      EBCDIC - to communicate with EBCDIC codes.  The default is network\n              ASCII.\n\n      HALFDUP - to operate under a half duplex protocol, i.e. with a\n              locked keyboard.\n\n              The EBCDIC HALFDUP the protocol assumes that the TELNET\n              break code (circle C) will be received to indicate when\n              the keyboard should be locked for input.\n\n              In ASCII HALFDUP the keyboard will lock after a line of\n              input and will unlock after one or more lines have been\n              received for output.  An external interrupt will also\n              unlock a locked keyboard.\n\n              The default is full duplex where the keyboard is always\n              unlocked for input.  A null line is required to\n              temporarily lock the keyboard in order to receive output.\n\n   Usage:\n\n      A number of hosts on the ARPA network provide TELNET service.  A\n      Network Virtual Terminal (NVT) has been specified so that using\n      sites can write one TELNET program which maps a local terminal\n      into the NVT to access any serving site on the network.  Once\n      communication has been established between a using site and a\n      serving site, keyed input is sent to the serving system and output\n      from the serving site, when received, is typed on the local\n      terminal.\n\n      The NVT protocol requires that the keyboard be capable of entering\n      all of the 128 ASCII codes together with a number of the TELNET\n      control codes.  To support an NVT with an IBM 2741 terminal, it is\n      necessary to adapt a control convention for entering codes which\n      are not associated with single keys on the keyboard.  In addition,\n      since CP/CMS processes input from a 2741 on a line at a time\n      terminated with a newline, a means must be establish for entering\n      a sequence of characters for transmission which is not terminated\n      with a newline code.\n\n      When TELNET is initiated the message\n\n                           ENTER CONTROL CHARACTER\n\n      is typed.  A non-blank character should then be entered which\n      defines the character which, in combination with another\n      character, will be used to enter codes not associated with single\n\n\n\n\nWinett                                                          [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 452                TELNET Command at Host LL           February 1973\n\n\n      keys.  The control character is also used for other special\n      control functions as described below.\n\n   Codes:\n\n      The NVT usually requires that characters be transmitted in an\n      eight bit ASCII code.  Since the TELNET command is written to\n      process EBCDIC codes ASCII codes received are translated into\n      ASCII before being sent to a serving site.  Figure 2 gives the\n      complete definition of EBCDIC indicating the EBCDIC controls and\n      EBCDIC graphics.  Figure 3 gives the codes for the ASCII controls\n      and graphics.  The complete mapping between 8-bit EBCDIC codes and\n      8-bit network ASCII codes is shown in Figure 4.  The EBCDIC\n      newline code (NL) is mapped into the ASCII codes for the pair of\n      characters CR-IF.\n\n      The following ASCII/EBCDIC mapping is used for the non-EBCDIC\n      graphics:\n\n                        ASCII   EBCDIC\n\n                   TILDE (7E) = (A1) NOT\n                     BAR (7C) = (6A) OR\n              BACK SLASH (5C) = (EO)\n                   CARAT (5E) = (71)\n                   GRAVE (6O) = (79)\n              LEFT BRACE (7B) = (8B)\n             RIGHT BRACE (7D) = (9B)\n            LEFT BRACKET (5B) = (AD)\n           RIGHT BRACKET (5D) = (BD)\n\n      The ASCII control DC3 (X' 13') maps to the EBCDIC control TM\n      (X'13').  The ASCII control NUL (X' oo') is sent to the terminal\n      as the EBCDIC code for NULL (X' oo') and is not mapped into an\n      IDLE (X'17').\n\n      The TELNET control hide-your-input is mapped into the EBCDIC code\n      for bypass (print suppress) and the TELNET control noecho is\n      mapped into the EBCDIC code for restore (print restore).  If the\n      TELNET control for echo is received, a message is printed and it\n      is mapped into an IDLE.  Similarly, if the TELNET control for\n      break is received, a message is printed and it is mapped into an\n      IDLE unless operation is in EBCDIC HALFDUP mode in which case the\n      break is used to indicate that any received characters should be\n      printed and the keyboard unlocked for input.  If a data mark or an\n      interrupt is received, no action is taken except to print a\n      message to notify the user of this occurrence.\n\n\n\n\nWinett                                                          [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC 452                TELNET Command at Host LL           February 1973\n\n\n   Input:\n\n      When the control character is entered, the following character is\n      mapped into a different code than that which it is normally mapped\n      into, except when the following character is a space or a\n      character not defined to have a meaning when preceded by the\n      control character.  Figure 5 gives the mapping of the characters\n      on a 2741 keyboard when preceded by a control character.  The\n      following 2741 keyboard characters do not have a different meaning\n      when preceded by the control character.\n\n      $ # * % \u0026\n      + - = _\n      . , : ;\n      ! | ? (cent sign)\n      SPACE\n      BACKSPACE\n      TAB\n\n      When a character is mapped into its control code, the control\n      character is mapped into the code for IDLE.  If the control\n      character is entered as the last character before the newline key\n      is entered, the sequence of characters entered is transmitted\n      without the newline code.  That is, the newline code is not\n      transmitted when it is preceded by the control character.\n\n      When the 2741 keyboard is unlocked for input, characters received\n      cannot be typed until the keyboard is locked again.  After a line\n      is entered, received characters can then be typed.  When operating\n      in full duplex or ASCII half duplex, a null line entered will\n      allow received characters to be typed but will not cause the new\n      line code to be transmitted.  To cause a null line, i.e., just the\n      new line code to be transmitted, the control character should be\n      entered as the only character in the input line.  In EBCDIC\n      HALFDUP a null line entered will cause a null line to be\n      transmitted.\n\n   Output:\n\n      ASCII output received from the NVT is converted into EBCDIC with\n      the sequences CR-LF converted into IDLE-NL.  The EBCDIC characters\n      are then sent to the terminal.  Note that not all 128 ASCII codes\n      when converted to EBCDIC will print on a 2741.  Of the 95 ASCII\n      graphics and the 8 ASCII controls which are defined for the NVT\n      printer, the following are not visible or audible:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinett                                                          [Page 4]\n\f\nRFC 452                TELNET Command at Host LL           February 1973\n\n\n            CARAT\n            GRAVE\n            BACK SLASH\n            LEFT BRACE\n            RIGHT BRACE\n            LEFT BRACKET\n            RIGHT BRACKET\n            ASCII CONTROL BELL (BEL)\n            ASCII CONTROL VERTICAL TAB (HT)\n            ASCII CONTROL FORM FEED (FF)\n            ASCII CONTROL CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)\n\n      Figure 6 shows how the EBCDIC codes from X' 40' through X' FF'\n      will appear on a 2741 terminal.  Figure 7 shows how the EBCDIC\n      codes will appear when printed with a PN train on the offline\n      printer and Figure 8 shows how these codes appear when printed\n      with a TN train.\n\n   Controls:\n\n      If the first character in an input line is the control character\n      and the next character is a space, the rest of the line is\n      interpreted as a TELNET control command.  A control command\n      consists of a control word and parameters separated by spaces.\n      Controls are defined which permit TELNET controls to be\n      transmitted to the serving site, allow input to come from a file\n      or output to go to a file, allow CMS functions or transient\n      commands to be issued, redefine the control character or TELNET\n      mode, close connections or leave the TELNET command with\n      connections still open, as well as controls to support a reader,\n      punch, and printer with RJS operation.
