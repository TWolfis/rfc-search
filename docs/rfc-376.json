Included here\nare the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES,\nMITRE, RADC, NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, NOAA, SAAC, ARPA, and BBN*).\nThis category also includes the Network Control Center computer\n(Network address 5) which is used solely for gathering statistics\nfrom the Network.  Finally, included among these Hosts are the\nfollowing:\n\n     Network\n     Address                  Site                 Computer\n     -------                  ----                 --------\n         7                    Rand                 IBM-360/65\n        73                    Harvard              PDP-1\n       138                    Lincoln              TSP\n        12                    Illinois             PDP-11\n        19                    NBS                  PDP-11\n        23                    USC                  IBM-360/44\n\n     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status\nfor this period.\n\nNOTE: Ellen Westheimer left BBN to return to school on August 4.\nWe therefore will discontinue the publication of these summaries.\nIt is my understanding that UCLA-NMC is considering the publica-\ntion of similar, although more detailed, survey data in the near\nfuture; I hope that data will serve in lieu of these reports.  In\naddition, of course, MIT-DMCG has had survey information available\non line for some time (see RFC #308, NIC 9259.)\n                                                 - Alex McKenzie -\n_______________\n*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and\nas such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being\nused to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n                                                             STATUS OR\n                                                             PREDICTIONS\nADDRESS  SITE           COMPUTER      STATUS OR PREDICTION   OBTAINED FROM\n-------  ----           --------      --------------------   -------------\n   1     UCLA           SIGMA-7       Sever #Limited         Jon Postel\n  65     UCLA           IBM-360/91    NETRJS now             Bob Braden\n                                      (Telnet in June)\n   2     SRI (NIC)      PDP-10        Server                 Jim White\n  66     SRI (AI)       PDP-10        Server                 Len Chaiten\n   3     UCSB           IBM-360/75    Server                 Ron Stoughton\n   4     UTAH           PDP-10        Server                 Barry Wessler\n  *5     BBN (NCC)      DDP-516       Never                  Alex McKenzie\n  69     BBN (TENEX-A)  PDP-10        Server                 Dan Murphy\n 133     BBN (TENEX-B)  PDP-10        Server(Exper.)
