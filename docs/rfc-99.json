The Wicker Room of the Dennis\nHotel has been reserved from Sunday, May 16 at 8:00 pm. through\nThursday, May 20 at 6:00 pm.\n\nSince it is not possible to reserve a block of hotel rooms, we will\nattempt to locate all of the attendees at the same hotel by handling\nreservations through MITRE. Prospective attendees should contact my\nsecretary Mrs. Marybelle Goodson, 703-893-3500 Ext. 2316.\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives by Markus Stumpf 4/97 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarp                                                            [Page 1]\n\f\n"
