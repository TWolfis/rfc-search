White\nCategories:  G.3                      Computer Research Lab.\nUpdates:  RFC 105, RFC 122               Univ. of California\nObsoletes: RFC 74                              Santa Barbara\n\n\n               Specification Changes for\n               OLS, RJE/RJOR, and SMFS\n\n     The following documents are hereby revised:\n\n     (1)  'Specifications for Network Use of the UCSB\n          On-Line System [16 October 70, RFC 74, NIC 5417],\n\n     (2)  'Network Specifications for Remote Job Entry and\n          Remote Job Output Retrieval at UCSB' [22 March 71,\n          RFC 105, NIC 5775], and\n\n     (3)  'Network Specifications for UCSB's Simple-\n          Minded File System' [26 April 71, RFC 122,\n          NIC 5834].\n\n     Revisions are as follows:\n\n     (1)  As far as can be determined, no Network site has\n          written code to interface to the UCSB software\n          documented in RFC 74 last October.  Accordingly,\n          UCSB has terminated support for that software,\n          and hence RFC 74 is obsolete.\n\n     (2)  In accordance with subsequent Host-Host protocol\n          changes, the notion of 'message type' has been\n          dropped from the specifications for RJE and RJOR,\n          RFC 105.  RJE/RJOR no longer send, nor expect to\n          receive 8 bits of zeros as the first byte trans-\n          mitted over a connection.\n\n     (3)  In accordance with Document 2, RJE and RJOR now\n          employ a standard ICP to create a full duplex\n          connection to the user.  Accordingly, RJE and\n          RJOR listen on sockets x'201' and x'301',\n          respectively (rather than on x'200' and x'300'\n          as before).  As documented in RFC 105, RJE\n          required only a simplex connection to the user.\n          A full duplex connection is now supported, but\n          no data is transmitted to the user over the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nNIC 7547\n\n          added simplex connection.  RJOR now also supports\n          a full duplex connection.  However, if RJOR is\n          required to call the user back when a requested\n          job's output is ready, it still does so employing\n          a simplex connection to the user's receive socket.\n\n     (4)  RJE/RJOR and SMFS specify a byte size of\n          eight for their connection to the user's\n          receive socket.  The user may choose the\n          byte size for the other simplex connection\n          to suit himself;  any valid byte size is\n          acceptable to UCSB.\n\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\n"
