G.3\nUpdates:  RFC #362\nObsoletes:  None\n\n                          NETWORK HOST STATUS\n\n     This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from June 19\nto June 30.\n\n     No testing was done on June 20 due to an attempt to install the\nnew IMP system.\n\n     Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing as\nthey are presently intended to be users only. Included here are the\nTerminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE, RADC,\nNBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, NOAA, SAAC, ARPA, and BBN*).  This category also\nincludes the Network Control Center computer (Network address 5) which\nis used solely for gathering statistics from the Network. Finally,\nincluded among these Hosts are the following:\n          Network\n          Address            Site                 Computer\n          -------            ----                 --------\n\n              7             Rand                  IBM - 360/65\n             73             Harvard               PDP-1\n            138             Lincoln               TSP\n             12             Illinois              PDP-11\n             19             NBS                   PDP-11\n             23             USC                   IBM-360/44\n\n     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status\nfor this period.\n\n_______________\n*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\nsuch is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used\nto refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nNO.
