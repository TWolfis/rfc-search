Crowther\nRequest for Comments #67                      BBN\n                                              [IMPORTANT]\n\n         Proposed Change to Host/IMP Spec to Eliminate Marking\n\n    Before he left for Norway, Dave Walden observed that there was a\nsimple change to the Host/IMP specifications which would eliminate all\n\"marking\" problems.  The change is to separate the leader from the text\nof regular messages, and then to send them as consecutive messages\ninstead of one packed message.  The text would then start on a word\nboundary no matter what the word lengths of the machines involved.  The\nprocess would take place on both IMP-to-Host and Host-to-IMP messages.\n\n    We can see no disadvantages to this scheme, and a sampling of Host\nreactions range from neutral to wildly enthusiastic.  Therefore, we\ntentatively plan to implement this change.  We recognize that this\nchange will involve Host program changes, and that the new release must\nbe scheduled to coincide with those changes.  We propose providing\nmodified Host spec text along with a one week notice of the new release.\n\n    If anyone sees a flaw in this scheme, or is unhappy about it, please\ncontact BBN quickly, since a new version of the IMP program is already\nin the works.\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n        [ into the online RFC archives by Kai Henningsen 5/97 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
