During this interval the PDP-10 at Ames which acts as a\nfront-end to the Illiac (Network address 15) became a server.\nHowever, this Host will not be available to general use for several\nmonths.  Also a Terminal IMP was installed at the University of\nSouthern California (Network Address 23) on March 29.\n\nSeveral Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These\nHost fall into two categories:\n\n1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as\nservers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis for at\nleast two weeks.  Included here are:\n         Network\n         Address              Site                Computer\n         -------              ----                --------\n           134               MIT-AI               PDP-10\n            13               Case                 PDP-10\n\n2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included here\nare the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES,\nMITRE, NBS, ETAC, USC, and BBN*).  This category also includes the\nNetwork Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is used\nsolely for gathering statistics from the Network.  Finally, included\namong these Hosts are the following:\n         Network\n         Address              Site                Computer\n         -------              ----                --------\n             7              Rand                  IBM-360/65\n            73              Harvard               PDP-1\n            12              Illinois              PDP-11\n            19              NBS                   PDP-11\n\nThe tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this\nperiod.\n_______________\n*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\nsuch is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to\nrefine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nSITE\n NO.
