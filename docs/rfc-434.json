At the end of the retrofit\n   program, the memory sizes of the various machines will be as follows:\n\n      IMP (516 or 316) - 16K words\n\n      TIP - 28K words\n\n      TIP with magnetic Tape Option - 32K words\n\n   In addition, the expansion of the TIP core memory will necessitate\n   enlarging the TIP to two cabinets.\n\n   Listed below is the preliminary schedule for these retrofits.  We\n   have arranged this schedule to coincide with the usual monthly\n   Preventive Maintenance at each site so as to minimize user\n   inconvenience, but the work required will frequently require the\n   machines to be down longer than normal.  I will issue additional\n   RFC's updating this schedule as necessary.\n\n   Any site which anticipate difficulty with the expansion of TIP size,\n   and thus the floor space requirement, should contact Hawley Rising\n   (BBN) at\n      (617)491-1850 ext. 473\n   All dates given below are in the form (month/day)\n\n   Xerox (1/3)\n   SAAC (1/4)\n   MIT (1/8)\n   MITRE (1/9)\n   Harvard (1/15)\n   RAND (1/16)\n   ARPA (1/16)\n   NBS (1/17)\n   AMES TIP (1/24)\n   Lincoln (1/24)\n   Utah (2/1)\n   UCSB (2/6)\n   Belvoir (2/8)\n   NOAA (2/12)\n   USC (2/13)\n\n\n\nMcKenzie                                                        [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 434            IMP/TIP Memory Retrofit Schedule        January 1973\n\n\n   Stanford (2/14)\n   ETAC (2/15)\n   Aberdeen (2/22)\n   ISI (2/22)\n   Case (2/26)\n   SRI (3/7)\n   Rome (3/14)\n   FNWC (3/15)\n   UCLA (3/19)\n   CCA (3/20)\n   AMES IMP (3/21)\n   GWC (3/22)\n   Carnegie (4/4)\n   SDC (4/17)\n   Illinois (4/18)\n\n\n         [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with    ]\n         [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.             9/99 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKenzie                                                        [Page 2]\n\f\n"
