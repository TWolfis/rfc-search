Wentheimer\nRequest for Comments: 252                       Bolt, Beranek and Newman\nCategory: F, G.3                                          8 October 1971\nNIC: 7696\n\n\n   The purpose of this RFC is to report on the recent status of most\n   Network Hosts.  During September 27 through September 29 the BBN\n   prototype Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) was inaccessible due to\n   hardware debugging.  The Network was, therefore, not examined on\n   these days.\n\n   Three Hosts which were not officially able to act as Server's at the\n   time of RFC #240 are now able to do so.  These Hosts are:\n\n         NETWORK          SITE              COMPUTER\n         ADDRESS\n         2                SRI (NIC)         PDF-10\n         6                MIT (Multics)     H-645\n         9                HARVARD           PDP-10\n\n   The Harvard PDP-10, however, has limited core space.  They will,\n   therefore, run the Telnet program only occasionally.\n\n   The following two tables summarize the information on the Host status\n   for September 30 - October 8.\n\n\n   NETWORK  SITE  COMPUTER          DAY, DATE AND TIME (Eastern)\n   ADDRESS                   TH    F     M     Tu    W     Th     F\n                             9/30  10/1  10/4  10/5  10/6  10/7  10/8\n                             1100  1753  1200  1600  1100  1300  1530\n\n    1     UCLA     SIGMA-7     O     T     D      O   #D    O     O\n   *65    UCLA     IBM-360/91  O     O     D      O    D    O     O\n    2     SRI(NIC) PDP-10      O    #D     T     #T    O    T    #D\n    66    SRI(AI)  PDP-10      D     D     D     D     D    D     D\n    3     UCSB     IBM-360/75  D     O     O     O     O    O     O\n    4     UTAH     PDP-10      D     D     D     D     D    D     D\n    69    BBN(TENEX)  PDP-10   T     T     O     O     O    D     D\n    6     MIT(Multics)H-645    O     O     D     T     D    T     T\n    70    MIT(DM)     PDP-10   D     H     D     T     D    T     T\n    8     SDC         IBM-360  D     D     D     D     D    D     D\n    9     HARVARD     PDP-10   T     D     T     D     D    T     T\n    10    LINCOLN     IBM-360  H     H     H     H     D    T     D\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWnetheimer                                                      [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 252                                                     October 1971\n\n\n   where\n\n      D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to\n      network partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal\n      IMP.)\n\n      R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)\n\n      T = Timed out (Destination Host did not respond in any way to the\n      initial RFC, although not dead.)\n\n      H = 1/2  Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then\n      either immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)\n\n      0 = Opened (Destination Host opened a connection and was\n      accessible to user.)\n\n      * The UCLA IMB-360/91 currently has Remote Job Service (NETRJS),\n        but has not implemented a full server Telnet System.  The BBN\n        Terminal IMP is not equipped to test NETRJS however, we are\n        assuming that receipt of the UCLA explanatory message indicates\n        that NETRJS is also functioning.\n\n      # These sites advertise that they may not have their system\n        available # at these times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWnetheimer                                                      [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 252                                                     October 1971\n\n\n   NETWORK  SITE   COMPUTER     STATUS or        \"STATUS or PREDICTIONS\"\n   ADDRESS                      PREDICTION        OBTAINED FROM\n\n     1      UCLA     SIGMA-7     Server            Jon Postel\n     65     UCLA     IBM-360/91  Remote Job\n                                 Service now,\n                                 Telnet in April   Bob Braden\n     2      SRI(NIC) PDP-10      Server            John Melvin\n     66     SRI(AI)  PDP-10      November          Len Chaiten\n     3      UCSB     IBM-360/75  Server            Jim White\n     4      UTAH     PDP-10      \"Soon\"            Barry Wessler\n     5      BBN(NCC) DDP-516     Never             Alex McKenzie\n     69     BBN(TENEX)  PDP-10   Server            Dan Murphy\n     6      MIT(Multics)H-645    Server            Mike Padliosky\n     70     MIT(DM)  PDP-10      Server            Bob Bressler\n     7      RAND     IBM 360/65  User only         Eric Harslem\n     71     RAND     PDP-10      January           Eric Harslem\n     8      SDC      IBM-360/67  \"Soon\"            Bob Long\n     9      HARVARD  PDP-10      Server            Bob Sundberg\n     73     HARVARD  PDP-1       User only         Bob Sundberg\n     10     LINCOLN  IBM-360     \"Soon\"            Joel Winnet\n     74     LINCOLN  TX2         Uncertain         Tom Barkalow\n     11     STANFORD PDP-10      November          Andy Moorer\n     12     ILLINOIS PDP-11      User only         John Cravits\n     13     CASE     PDP-10      December 15       Charles Rose\n     14     CARNEGIE PDP-10      January           Hal VanZoeren\n     15     PAOLI    B6500       Uncertain         John Cravits\n     16     AMES     TIP         User only\n     17     MITRE    TIP         User only\n     18     BBN(TIP) Prototype TIP   User only\n\n\n          [This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry]\n     [into the online RFC archives by Kelly Tardif, Via Genie 10/1999]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWnetheimer                                                      [Page 3]\n\f\n"
