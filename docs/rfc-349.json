This czar should also keep track\nof and publish a list of those socket numbers where host specific\nservices can be obtained.  I further suggest that the initial allocation\nbe as follows:\n        Sockets         Assignment\n        0-63            Network wide standard functions\n        64-127          Host specific functions\n        128-239         Reserved for future use\n        240-255         Any experimental function\n\nand within the network wide standard functions the following particular\nassignment be made:\n        Socket          Assignment\n           1            Telnet\n           3            File Transfer\n           5            Remote Job Entry\n           7            Echo\n           9            Discard\n\nthese socket numbers (decimal) are to be used for the socket called \"L\"\nin the official Initial Connection protocol (ICP) as specified in NIC\n7104 the \"Current Network Protocols\" notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
