TIP users should be uneffected by this\nchange since the TIP program has already been changed to ICP to the new\nsocket.  Because some user TELNET programs have been implemented a\n\"news\" command, the old socket will be maintained until April 15, 1973\nto give implementers time to change to the new socket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with    ]\n       [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.             9/99 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas                                                          [Page 1]\n\f\n"
