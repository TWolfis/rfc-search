Crocker\nRequest for Comments: 27                                            UCLA\n                                                           9 December 69\n\n\n\n                        DOCUMENTATION CONVENTIONS\n\n\n\n\nThis note is a revision of NWG/RFC 10, 16, and 24.\n\nThe Network Working Group consists of interested people from existing\nor potential ARPA network sites.  Membership is not closed.\n\nThe Network Working Group (NWG) is concerned with the HOST software,\nthe strategies for using the network, and initial experience with the\nnetwork.\n\nDocumentation of the NWG's effort is through notes such as this.  Notes\nmay be produced at any site by anybody and included in this series.\n\n\nCONTENT\n\nThe content of a NWG note may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related\nto the HOST software or other aspect of the network.  Notes are\nencouraged to be timely rather than polished.  Philosophical positions\nwithout examples or other specifics, specific suggestions or\nimplementation techniques without introductory or background\nexplication, and explicit questions without any attempted answers are\nall acceptable.  The minimum length for a NWG note is one sentence.\n\nThese standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two\nreasons.  First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as\nipso facto authoritative, and we hope to promote the exchange and\ndiscussion of considerably less than authoritative ideas.  Second,\nthere is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we\nhope to ease this inhibition.\n\nFORM\n\nEvery NWG note should bear the following information:\n\n        1.  \"Network Working Group\"\n            \"Request for Comments: X\" (X underscored)\n              where X is a serial number.  Serial numbers are assigned\n              by Steve Crocker at UCLA.\n\n        2.  Author and affiliation\n\n        3.  Date\n\n        4.
