(Monday, October 11 was Columbus Day.)  During these\n   two weeks, the general status of these Hosts remained as it had been\n   previously.\n\n   The table on the following page summarizes the daily information on\n   Host status for this period.\n\n   NETWORK  SITE         COMPUTER      DAY, DATE AND TIME (Eastern)\n   ADDRESS                              T     W     TH     F     M\n                                      10/12 10/13  10/14 10/15 10/18\n                                      1530  1600   1600  1700  1730\n   1        UCLA         SIGMA-7        O     O     O     O      O\n   65       UCLA         IBM-360/91     O     O     O     O      O\n   2        SRI(NIC)     PDP-10         O     O    #T     O      O\n   66       SRI(AI)      PDP-10         D     D     D     D      D\n   3        UCSB         IBM-360/75     O     O     O     O      O\n   4        UTAH         PDP-10         T     D     T     D      D\n   69       BBN(TENEX)   PDP-10         D     D     O     O      D\n   6        MIT(Multics) H-645          O     D     R     T      T\n   70       MIT(DM)      PDP-10         T     D     T     T      D\n   8        SDC          IBM-360-67     D     D     D     D      D\n   9        HARVARD      PDP-10         O     D     D     D      D\n   10       LINCOLN      IBM-360-67     D     D     D     H      D\n\n\n   NETWORK  SITE         COMPUTER      DAY, DATE AND TIME (Eastern)\n   ADDRESS                              T     W     TH     F\n                                      10/19 10/20  10/21 10/22\n                                      1630  1230   1330  1430\n   1        UCLA         SIGMA-7        O     O     O     O\n   65       UCLA         IBM-360/91     O     O     O     O\n   2        SRI(NIC)     PDP-10         T     O     O     O\n   66       SRI(AI)      PDP-10         D     D     D     D\n   3        UCSB         IBM-360/75     O     O     D     O\n   4        UTAH         PDP-10         T     D     T     D\n   69       BBN(TENEX)   PDP-10         D     O     O     O\n   6        MIT(Multics) H-645          T     D     D     O\n   70       MIT(DM)      PDP-10         D     H     H     H\n   8        SDC          IBM-360-67     D     D     D     D\n   9        HARVARD      PDP-10         D     D     D     D\n   10       LINCOLN      IBM-360-67     D     H     T     H\n\n\n\nWentheimer                                                      [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 255                                                     October 1971\n\n\n   where\n\n      D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to\n      network partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal\n      IMP.)\n\n      R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)\n\n      T = Timed out (Destination Host did not respond in any way to the\n      initial RFC, although not dead.)\n\n      H = 1/2  Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then\n      either immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)\n\n      O = Opened (Destination Host opened a connection and was\n      accessible to user.)\n\n      * The UCLA IMB-360/91 currently has Remote Job Service (NETRJS),\n      but has not implemented a full server Telnet System.
