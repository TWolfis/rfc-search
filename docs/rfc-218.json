The change will take place\nwithin the next month and should be transparent to the hosts.\n\n     The text status reports will be removed.  They have already\nbeen completely superseded by a binary version sent directly to\nthe NCC and are now just excess baggage.\n\n     The status reports will remain with the statistics program\non fake host 3, but will no longer be affected by any of the\nPARAMETER CHANGE parameters.  This will prevent the Hosts from\ninadvertently interfering with the operation of the NCC.\n\n\nBC/jm\n\n   [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n   [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n   [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
