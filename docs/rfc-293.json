Included here are:\n\n       Network\n       Address                Site            Computer\n       -------                ----            --------\n         133                  BBN             PDP-10 (B)\n           8*                 SDC             IBM-370/155\n          13                  Case            PDP-10\n          15                  Ames/(Paoli)    ILLIAC-(B6500)\n\n2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included here\nare the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES,\nMITRE, NBS and BBN**).  This category also includes the Network\nControl Center Computer (Network Address 5) which is used solely for\ngathering statistics from the Network.  Finally, included among these\nHosts are the following:\n\n       Network\n       Address                Site            Computer\n       -------                ----            --------\n          7                  Rand            IBM-360/65\n         73                  Harvard         PDP-1\n         12                  Illinois        PDP-11\n         19                  NBS             PDP-11\n\n     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for\nthis period.\n______________\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n*The SDC site is currently replacing their IBM 360/67 by an IBM\n370/155.  This site therefore is temporarily without any permanent\nHost on the network, and for this reason was not included in the daily\ntesting for the preceding two weeks.\n**The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\nsuch is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to\nrefine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\u003c In the original, the tables on this and the following page were typed \u003e\n\u003c in \"landscape\" format.
