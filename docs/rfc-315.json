On February 21 Massachusetts celebrated Washington's\n   Birthday.  During these two weeks the MIT Artificial Intelligence\n   (MIT-AI) PDP-10, Network address 134, became a Network User.\n\n   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These\n   Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n      1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network\n      as servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis\n      for at least two weeks.  Included here are:\n\n      Network\n      Address          Site            Computer\n      -------          ----            --------\n      134              MIT-AI          PDP-10\n       13              Case            PDP-10\n       15              Ames/(Paoli)    ILLIAC/(B6500)\n\n      2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included\n      here are the Terminal IMP's which are presently in the Network\n      (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN*).  This category also includes the\n      Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is used\n      solely for gathering statistics from the Network.  Finally,\n      included among these Hosts are the following:\n\n      Network\n      Address          Site            Computer\n      -------          ----            --------\n       7               Rand            IBM-360/65\n      73               Harvard         PDP-1\n      12               Illinois        PDP-11\n      19               NBS             PDP-11\n\n   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this\n   period.\n   _____\n   *The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\n   such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to\n   refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n\nWestheimer                                                      [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 315                   Network Host Status                 March 1972\n\n\n                                                          \"STATUS OR\n SITE                                                     PREDICTIONS\"\n ADDRESS  SITE          COMPUTER    STATUS OR PREDICTION  OBTAINED FROM\n -------  ----          --------    -------------------- --------------\n    1     UCLA          SIGMA-7     Server #Limited      Jon Postel\n   65     UCLA          IBM-360/91  NETRJS now           Bob Braden\n                                    (Telnet in April)\n    2     SRI(NIC)      PDP-10      Server               John Melvin\n   66     SRI(AI)       PDP-10      \"Soon\"               Len Chaiten\n    3     UCSB          IBM-360/75  Server               Jim White\n    4     UTAH          PDP-10      Server               Barry Wessler\n   *5     BBN(NCC)      DDP-516     Never                Alex McKenzie\n   69     BBN(TENEX-A)  PDP-10      Server               Dan Murphy\n *133     BBN(TENEX-B)  PDP-10      Server(Exper.)
