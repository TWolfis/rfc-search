Kampe\nRequest for Comments: 162                                       UCLA-NMC\nNIC #6774                                               Computer Science\nCategories: C.2, C.3, D.1, D.2, D.3                          22 May 1971\nUpdates: None\nObsoletes: None\n\n\n                              NETBUGGER3\n\n   NETBUGGER3 is a third level program for the debugging of second and\n   third level programs, experimentation with and simulation of third\n   level protocols.\n\n   We were writing an RJE FILENET to interact with UCLA-CCN, and\n   discovered that they (UCLA-CCN) wouldn't be up for a few months.  We\n   needed a program that would simulate CCN, so that we could interact\n   with it and debug our FILENET.  It occurred to me that all over the\n   network, people had similar problems, i.e., they couldn't debug\n   programs because the intended server wasn't up.  And so I started to\n   write a third level debugger-simulater.\n\n   With NETBUGGER3 the user can easily issue RTSs, STRs, and LISTENs,\n   interrogate the status of connections, receive and display NCP-USER\n   events and transmit and receive data over as many as twelve\n   connections (per copy of program running).  Received data can be\n   displayed in ASCII, EBCDIC on HEX.  The user can, of course,\n   originate data for transmission in the same forms.  NETBUGGER3 can be\n   initiator, receiver and/or intermediate in connections.\n\n   An example of how NETBUGGER3 could be of use to other hosts on the\n   Net follows.\n\n   Host X has a special third level Filenet to debug.  The host they\n   plan to interact with won't be up for several months.  Host X can\n   arrange with us to interact with NETBUGGER3, which will simulate the\n   proposed third level protocol and transactions.\n\n   An alternate possibility is for Host X to use his Telnet to enter our\n   system and start NETBUGGER3 himself.  He can then be running\n   NETBUGGER3 on one console and his filenet on another.\n\n   An alternate possibility is for Host X to use his Telnet to enter our\n   system and start NETBUGGER3 himself.  He can then be running\n   NETBUGGER3 on one console and his filenet on another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKampe                                                           [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 162                        NETBUGGER3                       May 1971\n\n\n   Then, later on when the other server Host is up, NETBUGGER3 can be\n   used an intermediate between Host X and his serving host.  Every\n   message from Host X to server and vice versa can be displayed,\n   examined and, if necessary, edited as it passes through the\n   NETBUGGER3 console, thus making possible the debugging and\n   measurements.\n\n   This is only one example.
