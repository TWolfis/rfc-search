Appendix B will be an alphabetical\nlist of all TIP commands.  The new commands are:\n\n     @BINARY INPUT START\n     @BINARY INPUT END\n     @BINARY OUTPUT START\n     @BINARY OUTPUT END\n     @CLEAR DEVICE WILD\n     @CLEAR INSERT LINEFEED\n     @INSERT LINEFEED\n     @SEND COMMAND\n     @RECEIVE FROM WILD\n     @SEND TO WILD\n     @SET DEVICE WILD\n     @MAG ABORT\n     @MAG BACKSPACE FILE\n     @MAG BACKSPACE RECORD\n     @MAG READ FILE\n     @MAG READ RECORD\n     @MAG SETUP COPY\n     @MAG SPACE FILE\n     @MAG SPACE RECORD\n     @MAG UNLOAD\n     @MAG WRITE EOF\n     @MAG WRITE TAPE\n\nThe MAG commands are, of course, not relevant to users of TIPs without\nthe magnetic tape option.\n\n     A TIP system including the above commands has been in operation\nsince late June.  We think this system is a substantial improvement\nover previous versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC # 365                                                  July 11, 1972\n\n\n     In case you've not been keeping track, there are now eleven TIPs\nin the ARPA Network.  These are ETAC, GWC, AMES, ARPA, MITRE, NBS,\nBBN, USC, NOAA, ROME, and SAAC.  Also, a TIP will soon be installed at\nCCA.\n\n     I'll now briefly discuss a number of topics I think may be\ninteresting to you.\n\n     Getting TIP status information.  As we develop new features for\nthe TIP and fix bugs, we are continually releasing new versions of the\nTIP program.  We do this by just reloading your TIP when you're not\nlooking (i.e., when no one is using your TIP).  In the future we will\nnotify you whenever a new version of the TIP program is loaded into\nyour TIP by adding a tiny \"status message\" to the \"HELLO\" you get when\nyou \"log onto\" the TIP.  This status message will usually be merely\nthe TIP's version number; however, occasionally the message will\nindicate (by typing \"NEWS\") that there is some news about the TIP's\nstatus which you should read before continuing your session with the\nTIP.  The NEWS can be retrieved by typing the command @NEWS which will\nICP to a special socket at BBN's TENEX or PDP-1D which will print the\nnews.  Of course, either of these systems may sometimes be down, but\nwe won't worry about the problem until we see how serious it is.\n\n     To whom to complain or make suggestions.  Many of you have had\noccasion to complain about the operation of your TIP system or to make\nsuggestions for its improvement.  All too frequently, however, these\ncomplaints have been directed to the Host system you are using from\nthe TIP instead of to us.  BBN maintains a Network Control Center\nwhich is always manned.  Its telephone number is 617-661-0100.  All\nTIP problems should be reported immediately to the Network Control\nCenter.  If you have a suggestion for a new command, or if you think\nyou've found a subtle bug in the TIP program, ask to talk to Dave\nWalden or Bernie Cosell when you call the Network Control Center.\n\n     Device buffers. In general, each TIP MLC port has a different\nsize buffer allocated to it and therefore to the device connected to\nthe port.  Devices which operate at higher speeds, of course, require\nlarger buffers, especially output buffers.  If you need more buffering\nthan you have (frequently indicated by output coming in short bursts),\ntry to arrange with whomever is locally responsible for the TIP you're\nusing to come in through a port with a larger buffer allocation.  If\nnecessary, this person can arrange with us to specially tailor the\nbuffer allocation for your TIP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC # 365                                                  July 11, 1972\n\n\n     There are presently only about 2500 characters of buffers\navailable for the TIPs terminal devices.  Since each device has an\ninput buffer and two output buffers (output is double buffered), each\nof the 63 devices has available an average of about 13 charac- ters\nfor input and 13 characters for each output buffer.  Since there is\ncontinual pressure for new features in the TIP and for old features to\nwork more conveniently, the space available for device buffers is\nsteadily decreasing.  There seem to be two ways to increase the space\navailable for device buffers; the first is to get more core memory;\nthe second is to modularize the program so that unneeded features can\nbe removed from particular sites.  For instance, the 2741 code and\ncharacter conversion tables might be removed from a site at which they\nwere never used.  You always have the option of getting more core for\nyour TIP; we are presently working on the latter method and should\nhave it ready in a few months.  In the mean time, the space available\nfor device buffers will probably continue to slowly diminish.\n\n     The nominal (untailored) buffer sizes are presently about as\nfollows:\n\n     device    input (characters)    output (characters/buffer)\n\n      1-3              60                        56\n      4-7              28                        27\n      8-15             20                        20\n     16-32             12                        13\n     33-63              6                         6\n\n     Echoing. The TIP's echoing capability has been a controversial\nitem in the past.  We have recently fixed it up a little and we think\nthat if you try it now, you'll like it a lot better.  Unfortunately,\n\"@@\" is still not echoed correctly very often; this is a bug and we\nare going to fix it, but it's hairy to fix.\n\n     We will shortly be removing three of the ECHO commands (ECHO ALL,\nECHO HALFDUPLEX, and ECHO NONE) and be slightly changing the meaning\nof the two other ECHO commands (ECHO REMOTE and ECHO LOCAL).  We will\nalso add two new ECHO commands (PHYSICAL HALFDUPLEX and PHYSICAL\nFULLDUPLEX.) Thus the new set of ECHO commands will be:\n\n     @PHYSICAL HALFDUPLEX\n     @PHYSICAL FULLDUPLEX\n     @ECHO LOCAL\n     @ECHO REMOTE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC # 365                                                  July 11, 1972\n\n\nThe ECHO LOCAL and ECHO REMOTE commands will probably be ignored for\nphysical halfduplex devices.  Therefore, for physical full- duplex\ndevices, ECHO LOCAL and ECHO REMOTE will have the effect of declaring\nthe device to be virtual halfduplex or virtual full- duplex. Devices\nwhich are known to be physical halfduplex (e.g., IBM 2741's) will come\nup in physical halfduplex mode.  All other devices will come up in\nphysical fullduplex mode and local echo mode (i.e., virtual halfduplex\nmode).  Whenever a connection is opened, the TIP will automatically\nsend off the current virtual echo mode to the server.  Whenever a ECHO\nLOCAL or ECHO REMOTE command is given, the virtual mode will be\nappropriately updated and forwarded to the server.  When the Telnet\nECHO (code 132) (=virtual fullduplex) or Telnet NO ECHO (code 131)\n(=virtual half- duplex) characters are received by the TIP, it will\nfollow the following rules:\n\n     ECHO received and\n          TIP is physical halfduplex -- NO ECHO  sent to server\n          TIP is virtual halfduplex  -- ECHO sent to server and\n                                        mode changed to virtual\n                                        fullduplex\n          TIP is virtual fullduplex  -- nothing\n\n     NO ECHO received and\n          TIP is physical halfduplex -- nothing\n          TIP is virtual halfduplex  -- nothing\n\n          TIP is virtual fullduplex  -- NO ECHO sent to server and\n                                        mode changed to virtual\n                                        halfduplex\n\nWhen a connection is broken, devices in physical fullduplex mode will\nbe reset to virtual halfduplex mode.\n\n     Some other command changes we are planning to make.\n     --------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  PROTOCOL TO LOGIN will be removed.  It has been replaced by\n    LOGIN.\n2.  LOGIN will take a parameter, the Host number, so it will not\n    be necessary to give both HOST and LOGIN commands.\n\n     Some things which we are presently doing.\n     ----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 4]\n\f\nRFC # 365                                                  July 11, 1972\n\n\n1.  When a terminal hangs up, any captured devices will be given\n    back.\n2.  Output to high speed devices will be possible.\n3.  Data sets will automatically be hung up when the caller\n    disconnects even though the caller never \"logged in\".\n4.  202C modems will work.\n5.  Major improvements on the magnetic tape option.\n6.  Trying to find the \"R half\" of the \"R T CLOSED\" message.\n7.  We have received numerous complaints that the TIP once in a\n    while loses an allocate.  We will fix this or else demonstrate\n    it's not the TIP's fault.\n\n     Some things we are thinking about.\n     ---------------------------------\n\n1.  Adding a lower case capability for Model 33 Teletypes.\n2.  Adding a mechanism so the TIP's status or a device's status\n    (e.g., its device number) can be obtained by the user.\n\n     Each of the above mentioned changes will be preceded by\nnotification via the NEWS and we plan to issue frequent updates to the\nTIP User's Guide from now on.\n\n     We are trying hard to improve the TIP.  If you've got a\nsuggestion (especially if it doesn't take any memory), let me hear\nfrom you.\n\n\n                          Regards,\n\n                          \u003c signed \"Dave\" \u003e\n\n                          David C.
