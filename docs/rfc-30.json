Crocker\nRFC-30                                                  UCLA\n                                                        4 February 70\n\n\n\n\n\n                        DOCUMENTATION CONVENTIONS\n\n\n\nThis note is a revision of NWG/RFC 10, 16, 24, and 27.\n\nThe Network Working Group consists of interested pleople from existing or\npotential ARPA network sites.  Membership is not closed.\n\nThe Network Working Group (NWG) is concerned with the HOST software, the\nstrategies for using the network, and initial experience with the network.\n\nDocumentation of the NWG's effort is through notes such as this.  Notes\nmay be produced at any site by anybody and included in this series.\n\nCONTENT\n\nThe content of a NWG note may be any thought, suggestion, etc. related\nto the HOST software or other aspect of the network.  Notes are encouraged\nto be timely rather than polished.  Philosophical positions without examples\nor other specifics, specific suggestions or implementation techniques\nwithout introductory or background explication, and explicit questions \nwithout any attempted answers are all acceptable.  The minimum length for\na NWG note is one sentence.\n\nThese standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.\nFirst, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto\nauthoritative, and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of\nconsiderably less than authoritative ideas.  Second, there is a natural\nhesitancy to publish something unpolished, and we hope to ease this\ninhibition.\n\nFORM\n\nEvery NWG note should bear the following information:\n\n        1.  \"Network Working Group\"\n            \"Request for Comments: X\" (X underscored)\n              where X is a serial number.  Serial numbers are assigned\n              by Steve Crocker at UCLA.\n\n        2.  Author and affiliation\n\n        3.  Date\n\n        4.
