Winett\nRequest for Comments: 183                             Lincoln Laboratory\nNIC: 7127                                                  July 21, 1971\n\nCategories: D.2, D.3\nRelated: 109, 110, 105, 158\n\n\n              The EBCDIC Codes and Their Mapping to ASCII\n\nAbstract\n\n   The uniquely map the ASCII codes into corresponding EBCDIC codes in a\n   consistent manner throughout the ARPA Network, this RFC describes and\n   defines the IBM Standard Extended BCD Interchanged Code.\n\nIntroduction\n\n   The IBM Corporate Systems Standard, Extended BCD Interchanged Code\n   (EBCDIC) defines 8-bit graphic and control codes (See Figure 1).  The\n   basic EBCDIC code consists of 54 controls (including space) and 88\n   graphics.  This set is extended to include 10 special graphics and 1\n   special control (EO).  These special graphics originate from the 7-\n   bit hollerith code and include 6 ASCII graphics.  The EBCDIC code is\n   further extended to include the publishing and printing graphics\n   option which specifics 52 graphics.  Of these graphics, 32 appear on\n   the IBM TN print chain.  Four of these graphics are duals with\n   graphics not on the TN print chain, and one graphic (degree) is dual\n   with a graphic in the special graphics set of the basic code (tilde).\n\n   It is desirable to uniquely map the ASCII codes into corresponding\n   EBCDIC codes in a consistent manner throughout the ARPA network.\n\n   For each of the 34 ASCII controls (including space and delete) there\n   is a corresponding BDCDIC control (assigning ASCII control DC3 to the\n   EBCDIC code X'13').  For 85 of the 94 ASCII graphics, there is a\n   corresponding graphic in the basic EBCDIC set.  Three different\n   correspondences can be made for the other 9 ASCII graphics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinett                                                          [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 183         EBCDIC Codes and Their Mapping to ASCII    July 21, 1971\n\n\nI.  IBM Correspondence\n\n   a) IBM recommends the following ASCII duals with the basic EBCDIC\n      graphics.\n\n           ASCII                   EBCDIC                  Code\n           [                       [cent sign]             X'4A'\n           ]                       !                       X'5A'\n           !                       l                       X'4F'\n           [carrot sign]           [upper right corner]    X'5F'\n\n   Note that the EBCDIC graphic for exclamation point (!) is not chosen\n   to correspond to the ASCII for exclamation point (!), though this\n   would be a sensible choice, and thus another code must be used to\n   represent this graphic.\n\n   b) Special EBCDIC graphics would be used to represent the other ASCII\n      graphics.\n\n           Graphic                         Code\n           l                               X'6A'\n           l                               X'79'\n           [diagonal slash]                X'A1'\n           ~                               X'E0'\n           [diagonal slash]                XC0'\n           {                               XD0'\n           }\n\nII.  Publishing Correspondence\n\n   a) Associate the following special EBCDIC graphics with the\n      corresponding ASCII graphics.\n\n           Graphic                         Code\n           [carrot]                        X'71'\n           [                               X'AD'\n           ]                               X'BD'\n           {                               X'8B'\n           }                               X'9B'\n\n   The codes for open bracket and close bracket are chosen since these\n   graphics appear on the TN print chain.  The codes for left brace and\n   right brace are chosen rather than the codes in the special graphics\n   set for opening brace and closing brace, respectively, since these\n   graphics are similar and also appear on the TN print chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinett                                                          [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 183         EBCDIC Codes and Their Mapping to ASCII    July 21, 1971\n\n\nIII.  Graphical Correspondence\n\n   a) Associate the following basic EBCDIC graphics with the indicated\n      ASCII graphics because of their graphic similarity.\n\n           |                       X'4F'           with |\n                                                        |\n\n           [upper right corner]    X'5F'           with ~\n\n   b) Associate the basic EBCDIC graphic for cent with the ASCII graphic\n      for reverse slash.\n\n           [cent]          X'4A'           with [diagonal slash]\n\n   This choice is made since the cent graphic is not an ASCII graphic\n   and is the only graphic in the basic EBCDIC set which would not\n   otherwise be associated with any ACII graphic.\n\n   c) Associate the special EBCDIC graphic grave accent.\n\n         `  X'79'\n\n      with the corresponding ASCII graphic.\n\n   d) Associate the following publishing EBCDIC graphics with the\n   corresponding ASCII graphics.\n\n           [carrot]        X'71'\n           [               X'AD'\n           ]               X'BD'\n           {               X'8B'\n           }               X'9B'\n\n   The codes for open bracket and close bracket are chosen since these\n   graphic appear on the TN print chain.  The codes for left brace and\n   right brace are chosen rather than the codes in the special graphics\n   set for opening brace and closing brace, respectively, since these\n   graphics are similar and also appear on the TN print chain.\n\n   Standards:\n\n   In order that the mapping from ASCII into EBCDIC and vice versa could\n   become standardized, I would appreciate comments on the above from\n   each site whose operating system uses EBCDIC as the internal code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinett                                                          [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC 183         EBCDIC Codes and Their Mapping to ASCII    July 21, 1971\n\n\n   Telnet Codes:\n\n   For those sites who may wish to provide our use TELNET services that\n   communicate using an EBCDIC code, a standard code must be specified.\n   The codes given in Figure 1 can form the basis for a standard.\n   Specific codes must also be specified for the TELNET control codes.\n   The following are suggested:\n\n                                   Hex Code\n           sync                    38\n           break                   39\n           NOP                     3A\n           Return to ASCII         FF\n           No echo                 14\n           Echo                    23\n           Hide input              24\n\n   To eliminate using one code for two graphics, I propose that the TN\n   graphics be associated with their corresponding code.  The graphic\n   tilde (~) might be assigned to the code X'E1' rather than keeping the\n   dual with the graphic for degree.  This would have no effect if the\n   Graphical Correspondence were chosen for the EBCDIC to ASCII mapping\n   with the code X'5F' for logical not associated with tilde.  The other\n   graphics of the publishing and printing option (Double Acute,\n   Inferior Hook, Macron, and Inferior Comma) which are not on the TN\n   print chain but have the same codes as graphics on the TN print chain\n   would not be considered to be part of the standard EBCDIC code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinett                                                          [Page 4]\n\f\nRFC 183         EBCDIC Codes and Their Mapping to ASCII    July 21, 1971\n\n\nEBCDIC Questionnaire\n\n   1.
