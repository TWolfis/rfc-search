Any change to presently established\n\n   protocol  is  going  to  involve  changes  in  the  hardware/software\n\n   development  efforts  that have, in some instances, been going on for\n\n   over 6 months.  In the case  of  Multics,  this  effort  has  yielded\n\n   programs  either  complete or in the advanced debugging stages.  This\n\n   is no doubt true for many other sites as well.\n\n\n       The arguments being developed  here  are  not  that  the  present\n\n   protocol  is  ideal,  but  rather that everyone has agreed that it is\n\n   workable and has begun implementation of it.  We would therefore like\n\n   to propose a moratorium on most changes to this protocol for the next\n\n   6 months, or however long it takes to get this system running and  to\n\n   observe its characteristics.\n\n\n       Specifically this means not making changes that only  effect  the\n\n   efficiency  or  ease of implementation.  If a major design problem is\n\n   uncovered it should still be brought forward  for  consideration,  as\n\n   could  issues that represent extensions to the existing system.  But,\n\n   changes to the details of the present system should not be made.\n\n\n       There are several points to be made in favor  of  this  argument.\n\n\n                                [Page 1]\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Working Group            RFC 72               Robert D. Bressler\n\n\n   The  first,  and  perhaps  the  most important, is getting the system\n\n   working as soon as possible.  The major benefits of the network  will\n\n   be  in the uses to which it is put, and development along those lines\n\n   cannot really get off its feet until the network is operational.   We\n\n   feel that, although the effort needed to reprogram part of the NCP at\n\n   a later date will undoubtedly be greater, it will be  hidden  by  the\n\n   parallel  effort  then  going  on  involving network usage and higher\n\n   level network development.\n\n\n       Another problem that immediately arises is what should constitute\n\n   an  official  change to the protocol.  The history of the development\n\n   of the current protocol shows that once an  idea  is  raised,  it  is\n\n   modified  many  times  before it is generally agreeable to all.  Thus\n\n   each new suggestion  for  change  could  conceivably  retard  program\n\n   development in terms of months.\n\n\n       Finally there  is  the  consideration  that  an  idea  may  prove\n\n   unfeasible  once  actual operation of the network begins.  Any one of\n\n   the currently agreed upon issues may  be  reopened  when  full  scale\n\n   testing begins to take place.\n\n\n       We think that these considerations are important enough to freeze\n\n   the  network  protocol  unless  any  problems arise that would make a\n\n   certain feature unimplementable.   Changes  then  leading  simply  to\n\n   greater  efficiency would be saved until actual network operation has\n\n   been tested.\n\n\n\n                                [Page 2]\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Working Group            RFC 72               Robert D. Bressler\n\n\n       This is not to say that new ideas  or  arguments  should  not  be\n\n   brought  forward,  but  that  they should be brought forward with the\n\n   understanding that they  are  not  to  be  considered  for  immediate\n\n   implementation but rather to be discussed with a view toward possible\n\n   later implementation.
