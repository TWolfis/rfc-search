Comments received since then (an RFC\n   actually generated comments!!!) have influenced me to propose the\n   following general rules for forming Host names.\n\n   The Host names will be 8 characters in length.  The general form is\n\n                     \u003csite\u003e  '-'  \u003cmachine\u003e\n\n   \u003csite\u003e will be at most 4 characters, formed as follows:\n\n        (a)  Use the keyword in the site name, if not more than\n             four characters, e.g., NASA Ames, Case Western\n             Reserve.                    ----  ----\n\n        (b)  Use the standard acronym, if not more than four\n             characters, e.g., UCLA, RADC, NBS.\n\n        (c)  If a standard abbreviation exists, use it, e.g., Ill.\n\n        (d)  If none of the above apply, use the first four letters\n             in the site name, e.g., Burr, Mitr, Harv.\n\n        (e)  If none of the above is acceptable to the site, the\n             technical liaison should select the site mnemonic.\n\n   \u003cmachine\u003e will be at most 4 characters of the form \u003cmfg. #\u003e\n   \u003cdesignator\u003e.\n   Examples of mfg. # are:\n\n             IBM 360             2 digit model number\n             IBM 370             3 digit model number\n             PDP                 1 - 2 digit model number\n             Burroughs           4 digits\n             CDC                 4 digits\n             etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC #247\n\n\n   \u003cdesignator\u003e will be used when more than one machine of the same\n   type is located at a site (e.g., 2 PDP-10s at MIT, at SRI, and\n   at BBN).\n\n   Limiting \u003cmachine\u003e to 4 characters does not permit distinctions\n   to be made between machines with 4 digit mfg.  #s.  I expect\n   the situation will be handled in an ad hoc manner by the NIC if\n   it arises.\n\n   TIPs are identified as 'TIP' rather than by '316'.  If a Host\n   is not to be permanently addressable, the machine is identified\n   as 'TEST'.\n\n   A list of Host names, formed according to these rules, is\n   attached.  Alternate Host names should be provided, as\n   suggested by Jon Postel (RFC #236).  RFC's 206, 233, and\n   236 present lists with 4-character alternate names.  The\n   Technical Liaison should select the alternate name for his\n   site and communicate the selection to the NIC.\n\n\n   The preceding rules and the attached list of Host names are\n   subject to the approval of the NWG.  Hereafter, the list will\n   be generated and maintained by the NIC in cooperation with\n   the Technical Liaison at each site, as suggested in RFC #237.\n   Comments should be addressed to Dick Watson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n\n         [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n\n         [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC #247\nAttachment 1\n\n          NETWORK ADDRESS                 STANDARD NAME\n          ---------------                 -------------\n                   1                      UCLA-7\n                  65                      UCLA-91\n                   2                      SRI-10NI\n                  66                      SRI-10AI\n                   3                      UCSB-75\n                   4                      UTAH-10\n                   5                      BBN-516\n                  69                      BBN-10A\n                 133                      BBN-10B\n                   6                      MIT-645\n                  70                      MIT-10DM\n                 134                      MIT-10AI\n                   7                      RAND-65\n                  71                      RAND-10\n                   8                      SDC-75\n                   9                      HARV-10\n                  73                      HARV-1\n                 137                      HARV-11\n                  10                      LL-67\n                  74                      LL-TX2\n                 138                      LL-TSP\n                  11                      SAIL-10\n                  12                      ILL-11\n                  76                      ILL-6500\n                  13                      CASE-10\n                  14                      CMU-10\n                  15                      BURR-6500\n                  79                      BURR-TEST\n                  16                      AMES-67\n                 144                      AMES-TIP\n                 145                      MITR-TIP\n                  18                      RADC-645\n                 146                      RADC-TIP\n                  19                      NBS-11\n                 147                      NBS-TIP\n                 148                      ETAC-TIP\n                  21                      TINK-418\n                  22                      MCCL-418\n                  23                      USC-44\n                 151                      USC-TIP\n                 152                      GWC-TIP\n                  25                      NCAR-7600\n                 153                      NCAR-TIP\n                 158                      BBNX-TEST\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC #247\nAttachment 2\n\n                  An Implementation Scheme\n\nIf the standard Host names are formed according to the proposed\nrules, the following implementation scheme, suggested by Steve\nCrocker, can be used.\n\n        Map \u003csite\u003e into an 8-bit number, S and\n        map \u003cmachine\u003e into an 8-bit number, M,\n        where\n                  S + M = Network Address.\n\n        S and M can be selected such that specification of \u003csite\u003e\n        alone could cause a default to the \"primary\" Host at\n        the site.  Note that this scheme depends on a unique\n        \u003csite\u003e designator for each IMP.\n\nSome examples:\n\nIf the \"primary\" Host at UCLA is the 91, let\n        UCLA  -\u003e S = X'41'\n           7  -\u003e M = X'40'\n          91  -\u003e M = X'00'\nthen for\n        UCLA-7, S + M = X'01' = 1 base 10\n        UCLA-91,S + M = X'41' = 65 base 10\n\nand\n        UCLA alone = X'41' = 65 base 10\n\nIf the primary Host at BBN is TENEX System A, let\n        BBN  -\u003e  S = X'45'\n        516  -\u003e  M = X'40'\n        10A  -\u003e  M = X'00'\n        10B  -\u003e  M = X'C0'\nthen for\n        BBN-516, S + M = X'05' = 5 base 10\n        BBN-10A, S + M = X'45' = 69 base 10\n        BBN-10B, S + M = X'85' = 133 base 10\n\nand\n        BBN alone = X'45' = 69 base 10\n\nThe primary Host for each IMP would be designated by the\nsite and such information disseminated by the NIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 4]\n\f\n"
