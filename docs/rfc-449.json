McQuillan et al, Improvements in the Design and Performance of\n        the ARPA Network, Proceedings AFIPS 1972 FJCC, pp. 741-754.\n\n    2.  BBN Report 1822, Specifications for the Interconnection of a\n        Host and an IMP, December 1972 Revision, section 3, pp. 17-35.\n\nReference 2 is particularly important reading for NCP programmers -\nthings have recently changed somewhat.\n\n    The inter-IMP acknowledgement mechanism, described in the last\nsection of Vint's RFC 442, is also described in reference 1 and an\nalmost identical mechanism is described in Appendix F of reference 2.\nThe acknowledgement is of only intellectual interest to most Hosts as it\nis transparent to network users.  However, the description in reference\n2 is of vital interest to so-called Very Distant Hosts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with    ]\n       [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.             9/99 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalden                                                          [Page 1]\n\f\n"
