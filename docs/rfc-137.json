It\n   represents a TELNET protocol felt to be adequate for initial\n   implementation.  A few recent suggestions by committee members and\n   others have been incorporated where even though not thoroughly\n   cleared with all members, the chairman felt that they clarified the\n   protocol or would tend to simplify implementation but not\n   substantially change the agreed-upon approach.\n\n   Readers are referenced to the following previous releases of\n   information:\n\n   1.

In performing this\n   function, the protocol attempts to minimize the amount of information\n   each HOST must keep about the characteristics of other HOSTS.\n\n   Definitions\n\n   Protocol Levels (see Figure 1)\n\n      Level 1\n\n         HOST-IMP protocol specified by BBN in NIC 5735, Specifications\n         for the Interconnection of a HOST, and an IMP (BBN Report 1822)\n\n      Level 2\n\n         HOST-HOST protocol performed by NCPs as described in Document\n         Number 1 (NIC 5413) and subsequent amendments, see RFC 107 (NIC\n         #5806)\n\n            One view of the NCP's function is that it takes information\n            from the net and routes it to receiving processes via\n            mechanisms internal to each HOST; conversely, processes use\n            the NCP, via internal system calls, to have information\n            routed to other processes in the net (via the other\n            processes' NCPs).\n\n      Level 3 (see Figure 2)\n\n         Level 3 is, by definition, the place to which and from which\n         the NCP communicates internally in its own host.\n\n            This level may be equivalent to the user process level in\n            some systems, but this may not be the case in all systems.\n            In using sites, the TELNET process operates at this level.\n            In serving sites, the TELNET server operates at this level.\n\n   Initial Connection Protocol (ICP)\n\n      An agreed-upon sequence of level 3 exchanges between two processes\n      which is, in general, used to synchronize the dialogue between the\n      processes, e.g., RFC 80 (NIC #5608) #1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Sullivan                                                      [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC 137                     TELNET Protocol                   April 1971\n\n\n   Serving Site\n\n      The HOST into which the TELNET process is directing the user's\n      keyboard input and from which the TELNET process is receiving\n      control information and data effecting the user's terminal.  At\n      the serving site, a TELNET server is executing.\n\n   Using Site\n\n      The HOST in which the TELNET process is executing.\n\n   Sending Site\n\n      The HOST transmitting data, could be either using site or serving\n      site.\n\n   Receiving Site\n\n      Converse of sending site.\n\n   User\n\n      The person or process \"driving\" the TELNET process.\n\n   In providing services the TELNET protocol will use established\n   network conventions, specifically the Network Control Program, and\n   Initial Connection Protocol referenced in the above definitions.\n\n   The TELNET protocol provides for a Network Virtual Terminal (NVT)\n   through which users may transmit and receive data over connections\n   between the using site and the serving site.\n\n   The code of the NVT will be full ASCII.  The seven-bit code will be\n   transmitted in eight-bit bytes, the high order bit set to zero.\n\n   It will be the responsibility of the using site to provide its users\n   with a means of producing all 128 ASCII codes, as well as a selected\n   set of special TELNET control signals (see Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Sullivan                                                      [Page 4]\n\f\nRFC 137                     TELNET Protocol                   April 1971\n\n\n   The ASCII character ESC will be employed by the user as an escape\n   signal indicating that the next character(s) has special meaning.\n   The meaning assigned to escape code will be serving site defined and\n   therefore may not be consistant across the network.\n\n   It will be the responsibility of the serving site to specify for\n   users how the NVT code will be used to represent the codes normally\n   generated by a local terminal.  The serving sites specification of\n   this representation is expected, where reasonable, to map on a one-\n   for-one basis for ASCII graphics and controls that are provided\n   through local terminals.  The serving site will also specify how the\n   escape conventions will be interpreted by the system.\n\n   The end of a line will be represented in the NVT as carriage return\n   followed by line feed.\n\n   The protocol assumes that at initially the serving site will not\n   provide any echo to the using site.\n\n   Each TELNET control signal for which code must be sent over the\n   connection will be represented in the NVT by an eight-bit code, with\n   the high order bit set to one.  Following are the special codes\n   established to date.

These do not require a corresponding control code for\n   transmission.  The local TELNET control signals are:\n\n      1. Transmit all data to this point.\n      2.

If the normal line length of the sending site is\n   greater than the allocation given by the receiving site, the sending\n   sites TELNET process or TELNET server will be responsible for\n   breaking the line into convenient lengths and turning them over to\n   the NCP for transmission.\n\n   This document will be revised as necessary to provide conventions for\n   data types, in addition to the NVT ASCII type.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n   [1] A one-byte DATA TYPE signal is sent as the first byte of data\n   over a connection.  A default is employed if the first byte over a\n   connection has the high order bit set to zero, and it is assumed that\n   the seven-bit ASCII NVT convention will be employed.  After initial\n   connection, the DATA TYPE may be changed (see code X'88').  Most\n   implementations and applications may expect the DATA TYPES to be\n   symmetrical at any point in time,(i.e. both using a serving site\n   using the same DATA TYPE.).\n\n   [2] A site receiving a DATA TYPE signal is to respond with a double\n   X'88' if the new DATA TYPE is acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Sullivan                                                      [Page 7]\n\f\nRFC 137                     TELNET Protocol                   April 1971\n\n\n|\u003c------- 32 -------\u003e|\u003c-8-\u003e|\u003c-8-\u003e|\u003c-- 16 --\u003e|\u003c-8-\u003e|\u003c---\n+--------------------+-----+-----+----------+-----+------------------\n|       leader       |  x  |size |  count   |  x  | TEXT\n+--------------------+-----+-----+----------+-----+------------------\n|\u003c---- level 1  ----\u003e|\n    message leader\n\n|\u003c------------------  level 2  ------------------\u003e|\n                  message preamble\n\n                                                         level 3\n                                                  |\u003c- message text..--\u003e\n\n                 Figure 1.
