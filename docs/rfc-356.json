Schedule\n    --------\nThe NCC operations staff has recently been augmented so that the NCC\nis now manned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Please be sure to\ncontact the NCC in case of any IMP/TIP or Network problems, at any\ntime of the day or night.\n\n2.  NCC Phone Number\n    ----------------\nIn the past we have been informed that persons trying to reach the NCC\nhave occasionally received busy signals.  In an effort to change that,\nwe have installed a new set of phone numbers for the NCC.  The new\nphone number for the Network Control Center is (617) 661-0100. Please\npost this new phone number prominently near IMPs and inform all\nconcerned parties of this new phone number.  (The old phone number\nwill also continue to operate, for a while.)\n\nHereafter, if you receive a busy signal (please distinguish from the\n\"fast busy signal\", meaning \"busy circuits\"), then please persist, but\nalso please be sure to inform the operator when you do reach him of\nthe the fact that you received a busy signal.\n\n3.
