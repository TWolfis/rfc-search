The mechanism is for each site to have a\n   Station Agent and a Technical Liaison Contact.  The Station Agent\n   maintains a small library of documents which arrive from the NIC.\n   The Technical Liaison Contact matches requests from the network\n   community to people or services at his site, and vice versa.\n\n   In my opinion, the current mailing list for the Network Working Group\n   seems to duplicate in large part the NIC's distribution system.\n   Therefore, I am making the following changes.\n\n(1)  Each site is presumed to have a Technical Liaison Contact.  Where\n     none has been appointed, the current receiver of NWG notes for that\n     site will be assumed to be the Technical Liaison Contact.  (Each\n     site may change its Technical Liaison Contact by notifying the\n     NIC.)\n\n(2)  NWG notes will be sent only to Technical Liaison Contacts and to\n     those on the current mailing list who are not at a site.\n\n(3)  RFC numbers and NIC numbers will continue to be assigned by Jeanne\n     North at SRI -- (415) 326-6200, ext. 4119, or use Enterprise\n     numbers:\n\n     BB\u0026N, CASE, HARV, LINC, MAC, CCA        Enterprise 0740\n     ARPA, MITR                              Enterprise 1-0740\n     CMU                                     Enterprise 9074\n     ILL                                     Enterprise 1074\n     SDC, RAND, UCLA, UCSB, UTAH             Zenith 9-0740\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrocker                                                         [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 95          Distribution of NWG/RFCs Through the NIC   February 1971\n\n\n(4)  NWG notes may be sent to the NIC for distribution, or may be\n     distributed directly.  If an author intends to distribute an NWG\n     note himself, he should so inform Mrs. North and obtain any changes\n     to the mailing list.  All mailing should be airmail or first class,\n     depending upon distance.\n\nThose on the current mailing list who are not at sites are\n\n   Alfred Cocanower                             MERIT\n   MERIT Computer Network                       (313) 764-9423\n   611 Church Street\n   Ann Arbor, Michigan  48104\n\n   Douglas McKay                                IBM\n   IBM Watson Research Center                   (914) 945-1159\n   P.
