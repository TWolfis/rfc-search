MONDAY MORNING SESSION (5/17/71)\n\nNETWORK INFORMATION CENTER\n\nPlans for NIC\n\n   Two activities are planned for this summer, off-line mail and on-line\n   access.  The off-line service will continue after the on-line service\n   has come into being.  Plans for getting on the Net via PDP-10\n   (replaced XDS-940) are almost complete.  Response times for display\n   use are marginal.\n\n   The activities will be developed in stages.  Stage 0 (June 18) NIC\n   will work with West Coast sites.  This will involve providing NLS\n   facilities to allow people to create messages with initial delivery\n   as hardcopy, etc., with automatic generation of catalog entry and NIC\n   #.  This system has been used locally for about a month.  Stage 1\n   (August 2) NIC will be open to the Net community as a whole.  Remote\n   users will come in directly to the on-line system and will have on-\n   line access to the catalog.  Users will be trained either at SRI or\n   at their own sites before coming on.  Four to eight concurrent\n   terminals will be supported.  Stage 2 will include file transfer\n   protocol, on-line delivery of messages, remote editing of SRI-located\n   text.  Prior to stage 0, a course will be offered (on June 16, 17)\n   for UCLA, Rand, SDC, UCSB, Ames, and RADC for the use of Stage 0.\n   The second group of users (after stage 0) will use NIC to do their\n   own site documentation.\n\nConcepts \u0026 Recommendations for Documentation\n\n   The NIC # is a unique \"name\" for reference -- it has no other\n   meaning. Other numbering schema such as RFC numbers will eventually\n   go away.  However, the subgroups, such as RFCs, will remain.\n   Appropriate set manipulators will be provided for assisting in\n   storage and retrieval.\n\n   The notion of functional documents was introduced (see RFC #115).\n   This is to be a document whose purpose is reasonably stable over\n   time.  It can have subdocuments that change more frequently.  A\n   current list of functional documents includes the NIC Catalog,\n   Directory of People, Resources Notebook, Protocols, and Site\n   Facilities (one for each site).\n\n   The mechanism of documentation is the responsibility of NIC; the\n   document contents are the responsibility of the author.  There are\n   two cases of document revision; replace part of the document and\n   replace the entire document.  In general, NIC would like the document\n\n\n\n\nHeafner                                                        [Page 18]\n\f\nRFC 164         Minutes of Network Working Group Meeting        May 1971\n\n\n   to be re-issued in its entirety with a new NIC # rather than issuing\n   errata.  The functional documents are in looseleaf form, new pages\n   can be issued with the same number and a revision date.\n\n   Documents are reproduced and mailed to site liaisons 24-48 hours\n   after receipt.  They are mailed to station agents on a weekly basis.\n   When mailing is handled directly by a site, a copy of the document\n   and a distribution list should also be sent to NIC.  In the past, NIC\n   has supplied abstracts of documents for the catalog; NIC requests\n   that the authors include an abstract.\n\nTELNET\n\n   The purpose of TELNET is to provide an immediate mechanism for\n   communication between keyboard terminals and serving processes, with\n   sufficient platform for later expansion and sophistication.\n\n   Tom O'Sullivan described TELNET as delineated in RFC #137.  (Later in\n   these NWG meetings, Tom issued RFC #158, a new TELNET protocol.)\n   After the description, many issues and questions were raised, viz.,\n   can TELNET expect \"recovery\" from NCP, 128 vs. 256 character set, DLE\n   + 7-bit code vs. high-order bit on, should protocol extend service\n   beyond what level consoles see, human factors, if information is\n   available at second level should it be passed to TELNET, TWX-like\n   service from NIC, mailbox protocol, etc.\n\n   In large part, these issues were raised but not resolved.  It was\n   agreed that an RFC would be forthcoming (RFC #158, published later at\n   the meetings) followed by a functional document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeafner                                                        [Page 19]\n\f\nRFC 164         Minutes of Network Working Group Meeting        May 1971\n\n\n                 III.  MONDAY AFTERNOON SESSION (5/17/71)\n\nFILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL (RFC #114)\n\n   The file transfer protocol (RFC #114) was described.  See also RFC\n   #133 and RFC #141.\n\n   A simplified version of RFC #114 is being implemented by MIT/DM and\n   MIT/MULTICS in order to: 1) allow Dynamic Modeling access to MULTICS\n   file storage facility and 2) conduct a pilot project to gain\n   understanding of such protocols.\n\n   It was noted that RFC #114 was not simple enough to implement for\n   TIPs.\n\n   A group was formed to meet Wednesday morning for more discussion and\n   to exactly define the problems.  The group would include\n   representatives from UCLA, UCSB, BBN, MIT, Rand, SRI, Harvard.\n\nFILE PROTOCOL STATUS REPORT\n\n   UCSB described the status of RFC #122, A Simple Minded File System,\n   as an operational program; not a proposal.  The basic concepts of the\n   file system were described; the design objective was to provide a\n   simple service quickly.\n\n   Currently one 2314 drive and pack is available.  At most four drives\n   will be made available during the next year.  It is also not clear\n   how long space will remain available.  The storage is currently free.\n\n   Sites that will use the file system are Mitre, via BBN, UCLA, SRI,\n   and Raytheon via one of the Boston hosts.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS TOPICS\n\nSockets\n\n   Socket name structure was briefly discussed.  Relevant RFCs that were\n   mentioned were 1) RFC #129 whose purpose was to describe socket\n   structures enumerated at the February NWG meetings, and 2) RFC #147,\n   a recently proposed structure.\n\n   It was pointed out that there was a definite need to reduce the\n   socket length from 32 to 16 bits (a TIP storage problem) regardless\n   of its structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeafner                                                        [Page 20]\n\f\nRFC 164         Minutes of Network Working Group Meeting        May 1971\n\n\n   A committee (Bob Metcalfe, Chairman with Abhay Bhushan and Joel\n   Winett) was appointed to produce a report in two weeks.  The\n   committee is to address the following three issues:\n\n      1) is a socket structure needed\n      2) are more than 16 bits needed\n      3) what procedures are recommended for managing socket numbers.\n\nInitial Connection Protocol\n\n   Race conditions and time out problems were elucidated.  See RFC #123,\n   127, and 151.\n\n   A committee (chaired by Jon Postel and including Steve Wolfe, Eric\n   Harslem, and Arie Shoshani) was appointed to clean up the ICP\n   specification.\n\nTesting and Validation\n\n   Sites wishing a remote partner to exchange NCP, TELNET, and logger\n   protocols can contact Rand.

MONDAY EVENING SESSION (5/17/71)\n\n   NOTE: Minutes of this session were kindly prepared by Bob Walker,\n   RADC.\n\nOPERATING SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS\n\n   An attempt was made to study the ARPA Networks from an academic point\n   of view.  An analogy was drawn on the basis that the ARPA Network\n   with its hosts and protocols is in a sense an \"operating system\" and\n   that a study of what makes a good operating system might help define\n   what makes a good ARPA Network.\n\n   Professor Art J. Bernstein of Stony Brook gave a presentation\n   abstracting what he considered to be the features of a flexible\n   operating system, the techniques for obtaining such; and when\n   appropriate, a discussion of those aspects where a difference in\n   techniques is required between dealing with an internal operating\n   system and dealing with a network.\n\n   The features of a flexible operating system were cited as:  (1) a\n   flexible file structure, (2) a process hierarchy, and (3) an\n   interprocess communication facility (IPC).  The terminology and\n   techniques described to obtain these three features were essentially\n   those developed for the MULTICS system.\n\n   A file structure capability was defined in terms of hierarchy of\n   directories, tree names, active file table, hold count, known file\n   table, and reference number.\n\n   A process hierarchy was discussed in terms of father-son relationship\n   and a father-node spawning a son node, creating an entry in the known\n   file table and assigning resources, all embodied in the SPAWN\n   primitive.  Implementation of primitives as time independent was\n   stressed as being crucial to Network activity whereas not necessarily\n   so for an internal operating system.  This lead into the concept\n   subcontracting process, where executive type functions are treated on\n   the same basis as user processes and as such are swappable.  The\n   \"link process\" was then described as the interface mechanism between\n   two cooperating machines.\n\n   Interprocess communication was discussed in terms of channels, status\n   return and software interrupts.  Appropriate primitives were defined\n   in detail as well as control type problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeafner                                                        [Page 22]\n\f\nRFC 164         Minutes of Network Working Group Meeting        May 1971\n\n\n   The discussion then went to file handling and a specification of the\n   required primitives and thence to directory handling, specification\n   of related primitives, and the mechanics of directory handling,\n   specifically the outstanding operation entry table in the executive.\n\n   After a short recess, Bob Metcalfe gave a presentation from the ARPA\n   Network point of view with reference to various points of Professor\n   Bernstein's presentation.  He noted the all pervasive tree structure\n   in Bernstein's presentation which appears to be most efficient to\n   internal operating systems (i.e., file system, process hierarchy,\n   etc.), but that the ARPA Network is not a tree structure but rather a\n   directed graph and that we should be careful not to impose tree\n   structure thinking on a directed graph type situation.\n\n   A number of questions and problem areas were elicited from the group\n   and listed on the blackboard:\n      1) How much does the operating system need to know about the\n         Network to get how much and vice versa?\n      2) Degree of transparency to the user?\n      3) \"Optimal\" resource allocation on the Network?\n      4) Autonomy versus centralization of control.\n      5) Resiliency.\n\n   The group discussed the need for a committee on Theory, how it should\n   function, how often should they meet, requirements for attendance,\n   etc.  Dave Walden was mentioned as a possible organizer of a related\n   effort.  Bob Metcalfe agreed to chair such a committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeafner                                                        [Page 23]\n\f\nRFC 164         Minutes of Network Working Group Meeting        May 1971\n\n\n                   V.  TUESDAY MORNING SESSION (5/18/71)\n\nDRS WORKING GROUP MEETING WITH OPEN ATTENDANCE\n\n   The purpose of the Data Reconfiguration Service meeting was to\n   resolve several lingering syntax and semantics issues and also to\n   receive comments and discuss the DRS with the entire Net community.\n\n   A brief overview of the DRS (see RFC #138) was given.\n\n   Remaining technical issues were resolved.  An implementation\n   specification (replacing RFC #138) will be issued soon.\n\n   Initial implementers and users were polled for schedules and initial\n   experiments, results are shown below.\n\n   MIT        No dates currently provided\n   U. of Ill. One or two months will be required to reformat from remote\n              formats to GOULD printer; also conversion of ARDS to\n              COMPUTEC strings.\n   UCSB       Implementation of service in two months; will provide\n              system forms for remote TTY-like devices to access UCSB\n              on-line system.\n   MITRE      Will compare performance of DRS to current software of\n              UCSB file experiment.\n   Rand       implement service by September; initial use to specify\n              UCSB RJE/RJ0 and UCLA NETRJS formats for local users.\n   UCLA       will have a compiler of forms within one month unless\n              serious difficulties arise.\n\nDATA MANAGEMENT ON COMPUTER NETWORKS\n\n   SDC presented RFC #144 (see also RFC #146).  Arie Shoshani presented\n   considerations and approaches that can be taken to achieve data\n   sharing.  The considerations were common language, sharing of\n   existing data, evolutionary/revolutionary, future and use facility,\n   further development, implementation, and speed.\n\n   Approaches given were:\n         1)  centralized\n             a) new data only\n             b) existing data\n         2)  standardized data\n         3) integrated - common languages + interfaces\n             a) interface on different nodes\n             b) interface on service node\n             c) Data Reconfiguration Service\n         4) Unified\n\n\n\nHeafner                                                        [Page 24]\n\f\nRFC 164         Minutes of Network Working Group Meeting        May 1971\n\n\n   Dick Winter described the CCA approach.  With several data computers\n   it becomes decentralized.  All data computers have identical hardware\n   and software.  Their objective is to dispose and restructure data\n   throughout the Net to optimize its use, i.e., relocate it close to\n   where it is used most heavily.  For small files of wide interest\n   multiple copies can be maintained.\n\n   Dr. Roberts commented that with respect to the Network, no\n   distance/cost relationship exists if data is retrieved more than one\n   link away.  The reason for putting files in several places is\n   reliability.  He views the CCA approach as a Net-level language, thus\n   the unified approach.  Also the natural language approach is suitable\n   as a research project but not suitable for data management for real\n   Net experiments.\n\n   CCA will present a proposal of data language at the next NWG meeting.\n\nOPEN DISCUSSION ON DATA MANAGEMENT\n\n   This time period was initially allocated to the description of a\n   particular data management system being constructed by Mitre.  It\n   became, in fact, an open discussion of general principles and\n   requirements for data management in the Network.  The following were\n   among the most recurrent comments made.\n\n   1.  DRS, file protocol, and data management should be examined in a\n       comprehensive way.\n\n   2.  Important considerations of data management are to allow users to\n       define and restructure files logically, to move towards\n       transparency of the Net, and to move toward natural language.\n\n   3.  A data management system should include functions for define,\n       access, manipulate, analyze, store of files.  For example, the\n       data computer doesn't do formatting for output (like an RPG), it\n       can take a number of conditions and do conditional retrieval but\n       not RPG.\n\n   4.  A data management system could be developed in stages where a)\n       the user explicitly moves data around the Net, b) the user\n       specifies the location but the access is integrated\n       automatically, c) location is maintained by the service.\n\n   5.  An area should be defined between file handling and application\n       specific manipulation, and the area should be treated in a system\n       wide way.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeafner                                                        [Page 25]\n\f\nRFC 164         Minutes of Network Working Group Meeting        May 1971\n\n\n   6.  The super file (too large for any one individual to economically\n       own) never came up before but it is reasonable for the Net.\n       However it is just one use and there still will be need of many\n       10^9 files.\n\n   7.  Privacy and security criteria should be applied at output rather\n       than input, which is an argument for having processing capability\n       at the location of the file.\n\n   8.  Dr. Roberts indicated that the things that are important are what\n       things are on the Net, and what things are there to say.  The\n       structure depends on what there is to say.  Thus, one should\n       concentrate on the language and not the structure.\n\n   9.  The data management system can be viewed as having two parts: 1)\n       the request, 2) the response and format.  On the response side\n       (operand side) there is the taxonomy of data types and a template\n       of data followed by the data.  A template is a string in which\n       data types or their descriptions are given with knowledge of\n       iteration, recursion, and data types.  On the request (operator)\n       side, templates can be used to precisely specify the data to be\n       retrieved, assuming the structure of the file is already\n       specified.\n\n   10. The disposition and request are over structures to the response.\n\n   A small group was established to continue discussion on data\n   management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeafner                                                        [Page 26]\n\f\nRFC 164         Minutes of Network Working Group Meeting        May 1971\n\n\n                  VI.  TUESDAY EVENING SESSION (5/18/71)\n\nTERMINAL IMP\n\n   The TIP can either be configured with 1) one host and two phone lines\n   or 2) three phone lines.  Interfaces will provide 19.2KB to lowest\n   TTY speeds for each line.  It can handle various terminals and\n   devices.\n\n   Normally the user speaks through the TIP but a primitive language\n   exists for talking to the TIP.  Commands will exist to do the\n   particular protocols such as logger.  Other commands will be present\n   for terminate on line feed, on character, now, on nth char., at end\n   of message, i.e., class of things to determine when message is sent.\n   There is another class to determine echoing.  Device rates can be set\n   up.  The serving site can also set up command such as capturing a\n   printer.\n\n   The TIP is currently trying to comply with all second and third level\n   protocols such as TELNET, file transfer (when defined).\n\n   Current plans are that the TIP cannot be reloaded through the\n   Network.\n\n   When new terminals are added, BBN will supply the TIP routines as\n   part of the service.\n\n   The TIP is intended to be used for RJE, terminal to process, and\n   later tape to tape.  The TIP is intended to be a switch rather than\n   an operating system, under the assumption that power will reside in\n   terminals and service centers.\n\n   The program limits the bandwidth -- the sum of input and output is\n   100KB.\n\n   Potential for TIP delivery is about one every three weeks after\n   August.  An upper figure for the TIP is $100K; the leasable terms are\n   $40K/yr. for three years plus a residual of $5K to own it, with a\n   two-year minimum.  This was designed as an alternate method of\n   purchase.\n\n\"COMMENTS BY DR. ROBERTS\"\n\n   The major cost benefit in the near term to getting on the Network\n   will be to use other physical systems to access new resources.  It\n   will be a number of years before people enter the Network in order to\n   get rid of machines or to boost CPU usage.\n\n\n\n\nHeafner                                                        [Page 27]\n\f\nRFC 164         Minutes of Network Working Group Meeting        May 1971\n\n\n   Regarding future Network growth, the University of California has\n   proposed to enter seven universities into the Network.  We should\n   have the data and program sharing protocols fixed by that time.  ETAC\n   will be working on the past 10 years weather in 10^11 store.  NCAR\n   will be trading time (a 6600 and a 7600) with them and with ILLIAC;\n   use is restricted to weather work.  January or February are probable\n   dates.  This will be a third cross country connection through UTAH\n   perhaps (second is via Omaha weather).  SC will be added in March or\n   April '72 for picture processing.  England will join about February '\n   72.  There are other plans to tie in Mexico, France, Israel,\n   Australia, Japan, Hawaii, Canada, etc. that could possibly all happen\n   in '72.\n\n   With regard to operating the Network, ARPA will not operate it\n   indefinitely.  One plan is to have AT\u0026T operate it since they can\n   legally sell the services; this will not come about soon.  A\n   commercial organization (not a common carrier) can only operate the\n   Net under Government sponsorship.  The current plan is to have BBN\n   run the Net as a service for the Government; this will be settled\n   within the coming year.\n\n   On the question of resources, setting up contracts with the service\n   people at each site to get one agent to ship money for various\n   subcontracts is a basic legal framework; for ARPA purposes it is\n   sufficient to have only one connection with each site.\n\n   On software development, the NCP progress has been extremely poor and\n   slow.  The second iteration should have been defined by now from\n   experiences with the first.  Towards the end of the year a new\n   protocol should be defined to last for a couple of years.  Accounting\n   and billing protocol should also be defined.  The NCP protocol is\n   getting to be a critical problem -- everyone should be complete and\n   consistent with the current protocol by July 1.  Without it, there\n   will be serious problems of bringing new people onto the Net.  For\n   example, the I4 and the laser store will be on the Net by March or\n   April of '72 with serious people wanting to use it (80% of its use\n   will be remote).  By early '72 the Net must be a solid working\n   entity.\n\n   The question of profit making time-sharing companies on the Net\n   depends on whether or not AT\u0026T takes over Net operations.\n\n   The capital arrangement for non-ARPA users to be on the Net is as\n   follows.  A federal agency can donate $76K and get a TIP.  Non-\n   federal agencies can pay $36K per year for the TIP for three years\n   plus the $5K residual to own it.  ARPA will not decide casually to\n   allow non-federal agencies on.\n\n\n\n\nHeafner                                                        [Page 28]\n\f\nRFC 164         Minutes of Network Working Group Meeting        May 1971\n\n\n   Regarding software support services, documentation will be upgraded\n   so all sites need not keep complete NIC documentation (except service\n   sites).  In service centers it makes sense to add one or two\n   personnel to work on net service programs, work with users, etc., if\n   needed.  Research centers will now have to concern themselves with\n   reliability, integrity, and problems of access.\n\n   Regarding the charging mechanism for the data computer, the 10^12\n   store cost one million, plus the cost of the PDP-10; thus 10^-4\n   cents/bit is reasonable for permanent storage.  The rate for short\n   term storage strips (like two weeks) will be about the same.  If\n   medium term storage is needed, a rate will be worked out.  ARPA will\n   pay for this storage as backup for the sites.\n\n   The on-lineness of NIC is very important for initial use, but we must\n   have something better than TTY or CRT.  The Net is cheaper than the\n   mails.  (Electrostatic hard-copy devices were briefly mentioned).\n\n   Regarding new developments for AI symbolic processing, a plan hatched\n   by Alan Kay is to have lots of processor, lots of core and a big\n   switch with the capability of serving users in the Net.  It is to\n   provide low cost core space (economics of processing are not known).\n   This may become associated with some experimental hardware\n   development facility since the desire is to be able to build new\n   architecture in a reasonable amount of time.  It should be 10 to 100\n   times faster than the PDP-10 with earliest delivery in '73.\n\n   The speech effort is on the order of three million per year.  The\n   concern now is to be able to tie together pieces at various sites for\n   comparative evaluation.  The cross-testing can have an impact on the\n   researcher, but everybody must maintain compatible interfaces.\n\n   The climatology program is for predicting future long-range climate\n   of the World that comes about by perturbations.  Various sites are\n   involved at various levels and it is hard to get these people to big\n   computers, to the data bases, and with each other.  The Network\n   provides their total communication path with the I4.  Direct and\n   effective use of the Network can be made without much more of an\n   investment; the Rand/UCSB work is a good example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeafner                                                        [Page 29]\n\f\nRFC 164         Minutes of Network Working Group Meeting        May 1971\n\n\n                 VII.  WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION (5/19/71)\n\n   This session began with discussion of file transfer protocol, led by\n   Abhay Bhusan.

This problem was referred to the committee\n   which met for the remainder of the day to specify the data transfer\n   and file protocols.

Read RFC #115 and RFC #118.\n\nNWG Organization\n\n   There is some concern over the size of the NWG.  Its functions and\n   reorganization were discussed.  Nothing definitive resulted\n   immediately.  It was suggested by Steve Crocker that another NWG\n   meeting would be held in August.\n\n   Dr. Roberts and Steve Crocker created a steering committee to examine\n   this and other problems.  More will be said about the steering\n   committee by Steve Crocker, at a later date.\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Nicholas Barnes 08/99 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeafner                                                        [Page 32]\n\f\n"
