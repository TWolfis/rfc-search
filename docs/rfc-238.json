In the Descriptor/Count mode, the Information Separators should\n   have a transaction sequence number field.  Otherwise, the receiver\n   cannot be sure he received all transactions before the separation.\n   This requires that there be two forms of information separators, one\n   for Descriptor/Count mode, the other for the DLE mode.\n\n   2. The modes-available handshake should not be mandatory, as it makes\n   no sense in the simplex case.  The receiver doesn't care what modes\n   the transmitter _might_ use; he only cares what mode _is_ used, which\n   he discovers when the first data or control transaction arrives.  Even\n   in the duplex case, it is not clear what use the receiver should make\n   of the modes-available information from the transmitter.\n\n   File Transfer Protocol\n   ----------------------\n\n   1. The protocol allows an end-of-file to be indicated by closing the\n   connection.  This is the same mistake which we made in an early\n   version of NETRJS.  Closing the connection without a File Separator\n   transaction should only be used to indicate an error, i.e., to abort\n   the transmission; it should never be used to indicate normal\n   completion of file transfer.  The reason is obvious: there is no way\n   for the receiver to tell whether CLS indicates normal completion or an\n   abnormal condition in the other host (e.g. the file transfer program\n   died).\n\n   2. There should be two forms of the _store_ request, one which fails\n   if a file of the same name already exists, and one which replaces an\n   existing file of the same name (as now).\n\n   3. A service center host may be expected to require username and\n   password transactions before any others are accepted.\n\n   4. There are no error transactions defined for lost data or lost\n   synch.  It is assumed there are handled at the DTP level?\n\n   5. All of the defined error codes should be allowed (and encouraged)\n   to have explanatory text following them.\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nRTB:gjm\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\n"
