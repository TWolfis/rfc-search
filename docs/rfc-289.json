Watson\n                                                 SRI-ARC\n\n   The enclosed is what we hope will be accepted as a list of\n   official formal host names and nicknames.  As no other subject\n   worked on by the NWG has generated so much comment, it is\n   worthwhile to review briefly how this list came into being.\n\n   The need for some standard set of names recognized by NCP's and\n   Telnets and usable on hardcopy to designate a persons affiliation\n   had been recognized for some time and several sets of names were\n   in use.\n\n   Peggy Karp issued the first formal proposal of a set of standard\n   names in RFC 226, NIC 7625.  This proposal was answered by a\n   number of counter proposals and culminated in RFC 247, NIC 7688.\n   People still were not happy with this proposal as names normally\n   associated with hosts or projects were not used.\n\n   At the last NWG meeting a number of people discussed the name\n   problem and agreed that the only reasonable compromise solution\n   was to have both formal names and nicknames and to let the people\n   at the hosts choose their own names within the guideline which the\n   previous dialog had seemed to agree on.\n\n   The guidelines were summarized in RFC 273, NIC 7837 and the NIC\n   agreed to collect and publish the names that the people at each\n   host indicated they desired.  A number of names were received and\n   a tentative list was published as RFC 280, NIC 8060.  More people\n   responded with their desired names or changed the ones in the\n   above list.\n\n   Almost all sites have since responded and the following list\n   resulted.\n\n   I think people should feel free to change their host name when\n   ever the situation warrants.\n\n    Formal Name                    Nickname        Network Address\n\n    AMES-67                                         16\n\n    AMES-ILLIAC                    I4\n\n    AMES-TIP                                       144\n\n    BBN-NCC                        NCC               5\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nNWG/RFC #289                                21-DEC-71 16:29  8295\nWhat We Hope Is An Official List of Host Names\n\n    BBN-TENEX                      BBN              69\n\n    BBN-TENEXB                     BBNB            133\n\n    BBN-TESTIP                                     158\n\n    BURR                                            15\n\n    BURR-TEST                                       79\n\n    CASE-10                                         13\n\n    CMU-10                                          14\n\n    ETAC-TIP                                       148\n\n    GWC-TIP                                        152\n\n    HARV-1                         PDP1             73\n\n    HARV-10                        ACL               9\n\n    HARV-11                                        137\n\n    ILL-ANTS                       ANTS             12\n\n    ILL-CAC                        CAC              76\n\n    LL-67                                           10\n\n    LL-TSP                                         138\n\n    LL-TX-2                        TX-2             74\n\n    MCCL-418                                        22\n\n    MIT-AI                                         134\n\n    MIT-DMCG                       DMCG             70\n\n    MIT-MULTICS                    MIT-M             6\n\n    MITRE-TIP                                      145\n\n    NBS-CCST                       NBS              19\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\nNWG/RFC #289                                21-DEC-71 16:29  8295\nWhat We Hope Is An Official List of Host Names\n\n    NBS-TIP                                        147\n\n    NCAR-7600                                       25\n\n    NCAR-TIP                                       153\n\n    RADC-645                                        18\n\n    RADC-TIP                                       146\n\n    RAND-CSG                                        71\n\n    RAND-RCC                                         7\n\n    SDC-ADEPT                      SDC               8\n\n    SRI-AI                                          66\n\n    SRI-ARC                                          2\n\n    SU-AI                                           11\n\n    TINK-418                                        21\n\n    UCLA-CCN                       CCN              65\n\n    UCLA-NMC                       SEX               1\n\n    UCLA-MOD75                     UCSB              3\n\n    USC-44                                          23\n\n    USC-TIP                                        151\n\n    UTAH-10                                          4\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 3]\n\f\n"
