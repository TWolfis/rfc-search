Can a technically competent person, initially uninformed\n         as to network operation and naive as to the capabilities\n         of various time-shared terminal systems attached to the\n         Network, be able to develop problem solving competence\n         at server sites on the ARPANET?\n\n     2.  What inherent user problems exist that complicate such\n         adaptation?\n\n     3.  Once proficient in the use, what aspects of the various\n         sites limit the usability and what modifications should\n         be considered at both server and user sites to meet\n         various needs?\n\n     4.  Should a user select a given site for composing and\n         editing all of his files for subsequent transfer to\n         other sites for processing or should he learn to compose\n         and edit at each of the sites doing his processing?\n\n     5.  What are the problems in starting cooperating processes\n         at several sites?  How does a user control such\n         processes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nObtaining the Answers\n---------------------\n\n     Under the direction of UCSB Professor James Howard, a test\ngroup of 14 graduate students was formed to pursue the questions\nabove, and any other aspect of ARPANET operation that they might\nuncover.\n\n     The test group has been given access to the 16 console On-Line\nSystem classroom in the E.E. Department at UCSB.  The 16 consoles\nproduce graphic and alphanumeric displays and are tied into the\nUCSB Host 360-75 which gains them access to the network.  Old\nstyle Culler-Fried keyboards are being used which provide a\nlimited key set  Jim White has managed to program around most of\nthe protocol problems brought about by these keyboards, but some\nstill remain.\n\n     Seminars were given to the test group to familiarize them\nwith software and hardware aspects of the ARPANET, the local NIC\nfile has been made available to the group, and the group has been\nallowed to sign onto the Network to pursue any available system.\n\n     Following the initial period of two weeks, during which the\ngroup developed some familiarity with the network, the test group\nhas been divided into working groups with emphasis as follows:\n\n\n         Patric Timlick      }      BBN-TENEX\n         Dave Stearns        }      BBN-TENEX B\n\n         John Pickens        }      SRI-ARC (NIC)\n         Doug Beaubien       }\n\n         Dave Whittington    }\n         Richard Haraguchi   }      MIT-Multics\n         Maria deGraaf       }      MIT-DMCG\n         Richard Melton      }\n         Su Sung Won         }\n\n         Ronald Varekamp     }\n         Jeoff Benson        }      UCLA-CCN    HARV-10\n         Hasan A.

Test group comments are\nitemized below with additional comments by the author {In braces}.\nWe plan subsequent reports on a periodic basis.\n\n     1.  We find that we need further information about access\n         to the NCPs at various sites.  User manuals from the\n         sites might provide this.  {Site response is solicited}\n\n     2.  We sometimes cannot sign into UCLA-NMC directly from\n         UCSB, but can do so readily by way of BBN.  {Protocol?}\n\n     3.  After running a Fortran or PL-1 program at some net\n         location we can only display the results on our consoles\n         but cannot store them as files.  {UCSB programming need?}\n\n     4.  When communications break down how can a user be\n         assured that he is logged out of some remote site?\n         {Need for automatic Log-out?}\n\n     5.  How do we make contact with programmers at other sites\n         to develop cooperative programs for file transfer, etc?\n         {Jim White?}\n\n     6.  Is there a best time of day for operation at each site?\n         Should contact be made with the site operator prior to\n         user sessions?   {Server sites please comment}\n\n     7.  UCLA-NMC has assigned a separate user identification\n         for test group use.  Would other sites prefer to do\n         likewise?  {Comments?}\n\n     8.  Is there information regarding uses made of the\n         various time shared systems by internal users at each\n         site?  Does a bibliography exist to allow contact\n         with such users?  {Check the Resource Notebook}\n\n     9.  MIT-DMCG and BBN provide very good user service,\n         especially the site survey.  Also these sites have\n         good responses to define events.  Can UCSB provide\n         local users with similar information?  {Jim White?}\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 3]\n\f\n"
