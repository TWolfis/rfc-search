Since then, other efforts have occupied NIC's time,\n   and the projeted bibliography of network reports is not yet issued.\n   In the meantime, several Agents have sent lists of their Site's\n   reports, and Peggy Karp's bibliography has covered much of the\n   ground.  In the meantime, also, the expected demand for a compilation\n   of references and for an accessible collection of the actual reports\n   has developed.  NIC has responsibility to satisfy this demand from\n   Sites for other relevant reports, to allow Sites to refer requests\n   for their own reports to the NIC for centralized handling, and to\n   provide Sites and others with bibliographic tools to facilitate\n   reference to all Network reports.\n\n   Requests from inside or outside the Network for reports performed\n   under an ARPA IPT Contract may be forwarded or referred to NIC for\n   answer.  NIC will not attempt to supply copies to outsiders, but will\n   answer the request with information for ordering from government\n   where this information is known, or will refer the request to the\n   report's originator when necessary.\n\n   NIC would appreciate receiving any other existing bibliographies of\n   relevant Site-produced reports.\n\n   NIC would also appreciate being placed on distribution lists for new\n   relevant Site-produced reports.\n\n\n          [This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry]\n     [into the online RFC archives by Kelly Tardif, Viag\ufffdnie 10/1999]\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth                                                           [Page 1]\n\f\n"
