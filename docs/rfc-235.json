The information\n   for these reports will be gained from talking to people at each site,\n   and from experimental \"data\".  These data will be the results of\n   daily attempts to log into each of the Hosts which might be\n   accessible to a Network user; the attempts will have been made from\n   the BBN prototype Terminal IMP at a random time each weekday.\n\n   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These\n   Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n      1)  Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network\n      as servers (available for use from other sites) for at least a\n      month.  Included here are:\n\n            Network             Site              Computer\n            Address\n\n             71                 Rand              PDP-10\n             74                 Lincoln           TX2\n             11                 Stanford          PDP-10\n             13                 Case              PDP-10\n             14                 Carnegie          PDP-10\n             15                 Paoli             B6500\n\n      2)  Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included\n      here are the Terminal IMPs presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE,\n      and BBN*).  This category also includes the Network Control Center\n      computer (Network Address 5) which is used solely for gathering\n      statistics from the Network.  Finally, included among these Hosts\n      are the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestheimer                                                      [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 235                       Site
