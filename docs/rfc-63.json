Cerf\nRequest for Comments #63                                       31 July 70\n\n                     Belated Network Meeting Report\n\nOn 8 May 1970, a Network Working Group meeting was hosted at Lincoln Labs.\nThe topics under discussion were:\n\n   1)   Lincoln Lab's Local Interaction Language (LIL)\n\n   2)   Records, Messages, and Format in HOST-HOST information exchange.\n\n   3)   Miscellaneous gripes\n\nThe first topic is thoroughly summarized in Lincoln Lab's Semi annual\nTechnical Summary titled \"Graphics\", dated May 31, 1970 (document id.\nESD-TR-70-151).\n\nThe second topic involved considerable  discussion of NWG/RFC #42 in which\nit was proposed that all messages be preceded by an 8-bit type byte which\nwould declare the format of the message which followed.\n\nThe following decisions were reached:\n\n   a)   Records may begin anywhere within a message.\n\n   b)   The first 8 bits of a record are reserved for type information.\n\n   c)   The first transmission on a connection starts a record.\n\nType 0 is agreed to mean that the transmission that follows consists of an\narbitrarily long record, and that no further type bytes will be present.\n\nThe notions of messages and records are independent of the flow-control\nprotocol.  Thus the receipt of a message does not carry any semantic\nimportance.  The receipt of a record, however, may initiate some interpre-\ntation process.\n\nAfter some discussion, the proposals in NWG/RFC #42 were permuted as follows:\n\n   type 0 = bit string of arbitrary length follows\n\n   type 1 = 8-bit ASCII follows\n\n   type 2 = EBCDIC follows\n\n   type 3 = MOD 33 TTY 7-bit ASCII\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nNetwork Working Group                                         V.
