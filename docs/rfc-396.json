The\ncomments generally fell into three groups:\n\n   (1) The meeting should be held at the end of April/ start of May to\n   coincide with the ANTS meeting being held here then.\n   (2) The meeting should be held in mid to late summer (majority said\n   this).\n   (3) The meeting should not be held yet, as there is nothing to meet\n   about.\n\n(1) That's simply too soon.  Admittedly it would be convenient, but\nsome people have other commitments on their time and that probably\nwouldn't allow enough time for preparation.\n(3) is not true, even considering my meager present and future planned\nneeds.  I hope there is a large group that shares this opinion.\n(2) seems to be the best idea, since everyone who contacted me\nobjected strongly to the 11th of May.\n\n     Bearing this in mind, I propose July 16, 1973 as the new meeting\ndate.  This should give everyone ample time to peruse James Michener's\n(at the moment) forthcoming RFC.  If you have specific questions about\npast meetings, committees, etc., this should give you time to get an\nanswer, also.\n\n     The meeting will be chaired by James Michener, Network Graphics\nGroup chairman.  A recording secretary will (if my understanding of\npast meeting protocol is correct) be volunteered at the meeting.  My\nrole has been, and will probably remain, clerical.  My phone number,\nby the way, is (217) 333-9354. It was shown incorrectly in RFC 474. My\napologies to those people who got the Publications Office.  I can also\nbe reached via network mail as user BUNCH at site USC-ISI (restated in\na vague, obfuscatory, and hubistic metalanguage, English, by popular\nrequest).\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                      1/97 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
