During this period the SRI-AI computer\nbecame a server.\n\n     Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.\nThese Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as\nservers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis for at\nleast two weeks.  Included here are:\n\n         Network\n         Address                Site            Computer\n         -------                ----            --------\n           134                  MIT-AI          PDP-10\n            13                  Case            PDP-10\n\n2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included here\nare the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES,\nMITRE, NBS, ETAC, and BBN*).  This category also includes the Network\nControl Center computer (Network Address 5) which is used solely for\ngathering statistics from the Network.  Finally, included among these\nHosts are the following:\n\n         Network\n         Address                Site            Computer\n         -------                ----            --------\n             7                  Rand            IBM-360/65\n            73                  Harvard         PDP-1\n            12                  Illinois        PDP-11\n            19                  NBS             PDP-11\n\n     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for\nthis period.\n________________\n*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and\nas such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being\nused to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n                                                               \"STATUS OR\n SITE                                                          PREDICTIONS\"\nADDRESS  SITE          COMPUTER        STATUS OR PREDICTION    OBTAINED FROM\n-------  ----          --------        --------------------    -------------\n\n    1    UCLA          SIGMA-7         Server #Limited         Jon Postel\n   65    UCLA          IBM-360/91      NETRJS now              Bob Braden\n                                       (Telnet in April)\n    2    SRI(NIC)      PDP-10          Server                  John Melvin\n   66    SRI(AI)       PDP-10          Server                  Len Chaiten\n    3    UCSB          IBM-360/75      Server                  Jim White\n    4    UTAH          PDP-10          Server                  Barry Wessler\n   *5    BBN(NCC)      DDP-516         Never                   Alex McKenzie\n   69    BBN(TENEX-A)  PDP-10          Server                  Dan Murphy\n *133    BBN(TENEX-B)  PDP-10          Server (Exper.)
