The using NCP thus\nsends\n\n\n               1            4               4                 1\n             ---------------------------------------------------\n             |RTS |         US     |        1          |      p|\n             ---------------------------------------------------\n             |ALL |     P    |    space    |\n             -------------------------------\n\nover link 1, where US is the user's receive socket, p is the link, and\nspace is some nominal spae allocation.\n\n\nThe serving Host may decide to refuse contact, in which case it will\nrespond with the standard CLS. If it accepts contact, however, it will\nsend exactly an even 32 bit number over the connection and close the\nconnection. This even 32 bit number is the name of a receive socket in\nthe serving Host. This socket and the next higher numbered socket are\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 66              3rd Level Ideas and other Noise\n\n\nNetwork Working Group                                   S.
