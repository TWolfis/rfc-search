The purpose of this\nRequest for Comments is threefold:\n\n     1. to inform the Network Working Group of the\n        existence of this information gathering service\n        and about getting access to it,\n\n     2. to present the results of SURVEY for its first\n        few months, and\n\n     3. to correct errors in our data or collection methods.\n\n     Briefly, the SURVEY program works as follows: At 15-minute\nintervals whenever the MIT-DMCG ITS Time-Sharing system is in normal\noperation, a SURVEY is started.  The SURVEY program attempts to\nestablish a connection to the LOGGER (socket 1) of each HOST listed in\nits table.  The results of each connection attempt are recorded for\nfuture reference.  The Initial Connection Protocol is aborted prior to\nreading the transmitted socket number so as to cause the minimum\namount of processing at SURVEYed HOSTS.  If the LOGGER connection\nsucceeds, the average request-for connection response time (in\nseconds) for the HOST is updated.  This information can later be\nviewed in several formats using the MIT-DMCG server TELNET \"NETWRK\" as\ndescribed below.\n\n     Each test results in the assignment of one of the following\nfive statuses:\n\n     1.  LOGGER available - connection completed.\n\n     2.  LOGGER not responding - RFC sent (HOST-HOST OK), but\n         no response (20 seconds allowed).\n\n     3.  LOGGER rejecting - CLOSE returned by NCP.\n\n     4.  NCP not responding - RESET timed out (15 seconds allowed).\n\n     5.  HOST dead - host-dead status returned by IMP.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nBelow you will find a summary of the information gathered to\ndate.  It must be remembered that the SURVEY program can only run when\nMIT-DMCG ITS Time-Sharing System is in normal operation and the MIT\nIMP is operational.  Thus the current figure of 94% for MIT-DMCG is\ninaccurate. (It should actually be closer to 66%.)\n\n     There are, in addition, two other shortcomings of which we are\naware.  The first is that SURVEY is on a 24-hour basis and does _not_\nconsider advertised up time.  For example, MIT-DMCG will never be\nbetter than 67% on a Tuesday since the machine is always unavailable\nfrom 4 p.m. to midnight.  The second shortcoming is the fact that the\nLincoln Lab's TX-2 shows as \"never available\".  This reflects an as\nyet undiagnosed problem currently under investigation.\n\n     To get availability information from DMCG, you must first follow\nthe scenario in RFC 254.  Once in NETWRK, the DMCG user-TELNET, there\nare seven available commands which pertain to SURVEY data:\n\n     SUMMARY.OF.SURVEYS - summarizes most recent information.\n\n     HISTORY.OF. \u003chost name\u003e - gives a detailed recent history\n                    of the given host.  This generates a lot\n                    of output, so use it sparingly.\n\n     ACTIVE.HOSTS - lists those hosts who accepted a connection\n                    at least once during the last 24 hours.\n\n     BEST.SURVEY - lists the best of the recent surveys.\n\n     LONGTERM SUMMARY.OF.SURVEYS - summarizes all past\n                    information.  This was used to generate\n                    the table on the next page.\n\n\n     LONGTERM HISTORY.OF \u003chost name\u003e - gives a summary of\n                    past history of the given host.  It\n                    does not generate as much output as the\n                    HISTORY command.\n\n     LONGTERM ACTIVE.HOSTS - lists those hosts who accepted a\n                    connection at least once since December 13,\n                    1971.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\nFor the above seven commands, \"recent\" is define as \"within the\nlast 24 hours or less\".\n\n     For help in accessing SURVEY data and comments on improving the\nadmittedly limited SURVEY service, please contact:\n\n          Marc Seriff\n          M.I.T. - Project MAC\n          545 Main Street\n          Cambridge, Mass. 02139\n          (617) 864-6900 ext. 1458\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 3]\n\f\n6528 Surveys from 09:55:18 on 12/13/71 to 08:50:41 on 03/20/72\n--HOST-- -#- -%-UP- -RESP- *\nucla-nmc 001  064%   00.93\nsri-arc  002  064%   02.96\nucsb-75  003  048%   00.53\nutah-10  004  057%   03.23\nbbn-ncc  005  000%   00.00\nmultics  006  047%   05.60\nrand-rcc 007  000%   00.13\nsdcadept 010  000%   02.60\nharv-10  011  022%   00.23\nll-67    012  021%   03.70\nsu-sail  013  000%   00.00\nill-11   014  000%   00.06\ncase-10  015  000%   00.00\ncmu-10   016  034%   00.23\nburr     017  000%   00.00\names-67  020  000%   00.00\nradc-645 022  000%   00.00 **\nnbs-11   023  000%   00.00 **\ntink-418 025  000%   00.00 **\nusc-44   027  000%   01.13 **\nncar7600 031  000%   00.00 **\nucla-ccn 101  070%   00.30\nsri-ai   102  000%   02.26\ntenex    105  060%   02.40\nmit-dmcg 106  093%   01.10 ***\nrand-csg 107  013%   02.96 **\nharv-1   111  000%   00.23\nll-tx2   112  000%   01.76\nill-6500 114  000%   00.00\nburrtest 117  000%   00.00 **\ntenexb   205  018%   02.93\nmit-ai   206  000%   00.00\nharv-11  211  000%   00.00\n\n* Remember that \"UP is defined as \"Logger Accepting connections.\"\n** Surveyed only since February 18, 1972.\n*** MIT-DMCG is actually up about 66% of the time.\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 4]\n\f\n"
