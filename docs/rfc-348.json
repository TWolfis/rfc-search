Upon completion of the ICP\nthe discard process would wait for data from the network.  When data is\nreceived from the network it is discarded at once, (and the buffer space\nis re-allocated).  The discard process is terminated by closing the\nnetwork connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
