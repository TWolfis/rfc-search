Listed below are the ICP sockets for the currently\nsupported terminals and protocols.  Any detailed questions about or\nproblems with a particular protocol should be directed to Ed Faeh\n(805-961-4047).\n\n   Socket                       Supports\n\n   x'701'               IMLAC with special software designed\n                        by Jerry Powell (MITRE Corp.).\n                        Graphics is sent over a simplex\n                        connection to the IMLAC.  Alphanumerics\n                        are sent over a TELNET-like connection\n                        to a separate device.  The IMLAC\n                        software can be loaded from MIT-DMCG.\n\n   x'703'               IMLAC with 80x80 display grid\n                        and Standard Text and Edit Package.\n                        Some IMLACs have a 64x64 display grid.\n                        Therefore, the choice may be made in\n                        the near future to format the\n                        graphics output from this connection\n                        for the smaller grid resolution so\n                        that both terminal types may be handled.\n                        Display resolution is limited with\n                        this terminal configuration as\n                        normal UCSB terminals have 1024x1024\n                        grid.  Nevertheless, meaningful\n                        displays are obtained even at the\n                        lower resolutions.\n\n   x'705'               Current Level 0 graphics protocol.\n\n   x'707'               Same as x'701' but with special\n                        UCSB online keyboard as input.\n                        This configuration averts the\n                        necessity of spelling out online\n                        operators.\n\n   x'709'               Same as x'705' but with special\n                        UCSB online keyboard as input.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nNWG/RFC# 398                        JRP EDF 22-SEP-72 16:25  11911\nUCSB OnLine Graphics\n\n\n   x'801'               TEKTRONIX terminals.  Models 4002-A\n                        4010, and T-4002 have been tested\n                        successfully.  Presumably all other\n                        4002 compatible terminals will also work.\n\nThe primary problems that will be encountered by the network user\ncenter about display formatting.  For historical reasons (i.e.  only\none type of terminal in house ) no means were included in the system\nto facilitate terminal independent random positioning of alphanumeric\noutput.  Thus, a program which draws and labels a graph neatly on one\nterminal might label like a kindergartener on other terminals.\nNevertheless, this problem can be minimized with careful programming\nand efforts are underway to provide at least minimal alphanumeric\ndevice independence.\n\nUsers interested in experimenting with online graphics should contact\nJohn Pickens (805-961-3454), Glen Davis (805-961-2462), or Mark\nKrilonovich (805-961-3454).  Suggestions and criticisms of all aspects\nof the UCSB OnLine - Network User interface are desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                      1/97 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\n"
