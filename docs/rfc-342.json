G.3\nUpdates:  RFC #332\nObsoletes:  None\n\n                          NETWORK HOST STATUS\n\n        This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from April\n   24 to May 5.  During this interval the IBM 360/44 at the University\n   of Southern California (Network Address 23) became a Network user.\n\n        Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.\n   These Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n        1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network\n   as servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis\n   for at least two weeks.  Included here are:\n\n         Network\n         Address              Site               Computer\n         -------              ----               --------\n           134               MIT-AI              PDP-10\n            13               Case                PDP-10\n\n        2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.\n   Included here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the\n   Network (AMES, MITRE, NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, and BBN*).  This category\n   also includes the Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5)\n   which is used solely for gathering statistics from the Network.\n   Finally, included among these Hosts are the following:\n\n         Network\n         Address              Site               Computer\n         -------              ----               --------\n             7               Rand                IBM-360/65\n            73               Harvard             PDP-1\n            12               Illinois            PDP-11\n            19               NBS                 PDP-11\n            23               USC                 IBM-360/44\n\n        The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for\n   this period.\n   _____________\n   *The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as such\n   is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to refine\n   and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nSITE\n NO.
