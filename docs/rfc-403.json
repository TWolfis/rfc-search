Hicks\nNIC: 11925                                                          Utah\n                                                        January 10, 1973\n\n\n                 Desirability of a Network 1108 Service\n\n   We have, at the University of Utah, a Univac 1108 that supports the\n   Univac EXEC 8 system.  At the recent ICCC conference in Washington,\n   there was some interest expressed in making this computer available\n   to the ARPANET.  At present it is not so available.  Since there is\n   communication currently between the 1108 and the Utah PDP-10, it\n   would require minimal programming effort to make the 1109 available\n   for network use.\n\n   We would appreciate your comments if you think this service would be\n   desirable.  Please direct your comments to:\n\n      Gregory Hicks\n      Computer Science Department\n      Merrill Engineering Building 3160\n      University of Utah\n      Salt Lake City, Utah 84112\n\n   or to:\n\n      Ed Sharp\n      Director, Computer Center\n      Merrill Engineering Building 3116\n      University of Utah\n      Salt Lake City, Utah 84112\n\n   Enclosed please find:\n\n      (1) a brief description of the services available.\n      (2) pricing schedule.\n      (3) time schedule when the EXEC 8 system is available for use.\n\n   Facilities at the University of Utah\n\n   The university of Utah owns a large Univac 1108 computer system with\n   six tape drives, seven high speed drums, 262 megabytes of on line\n   storage, as well as communication equipment for low speed (teletype)\n   timesharing and high speed (Remote Job Entry or RJE) batch terminals.\n   The Computer Center also has available a large (48\" x 60\") high\n   precision flatbed Plotter, an Optical Scanner and Digitizer.  Current\n   (December 72) remote terminals include RJE devices in Logan, Provo,\n\n\n\nHicks                                                           [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 403          Desirability of a Network 1108 Service     January 1973\n\n\n   and Salt Lake City (four terminals): Montrose, Durango, Boise and\n   Boulder City, as well as timesharing devices in several of the\n   western states.  RJE terminals will shortly be ordered for Denver,\n   Amarillo, Billings and Sacramento.  Additional ports have been\n   ordered to allow for further timesharing use of the 1108.\n\n   The Center is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Computing\n   rates are considerably lower than commercial rates and jobs generally\n   cost less to process at the University than at other state\n   facilities.\n\n   Available software include languages such as FORTAN, COBAL, SNOBOL,\n   APL, BASIC, MAD, ALGOL, LISP, a Text Editor and an Assembler.  A wide\n   variety of scientific and statistical routines are available,\n   including the two best known statistical systems and an excellent set\n   of mathematical subprograms.  Several simulation packages, as well as\n   an LP program, are available for use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHicks                                                           [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 403          Desirability of a Network 1108 Service     January 1973\n\n\n                  1108 COMPUTER PRIORITY/RATE SCHEDULE\n\n                                 RATE IN               RATE IN\n                       PRIORITY  CENTS/SEC.

If you are\n   planning to do on site work a call to 581-6111 will confirm the\n   current operation status of the facilities.  Normally, we expect to\n   get all jobs with priority of 'R' or higher run overnight.  We cannot\n   guarantee overnight turn around of priority S and below but every\n   effort will be made to accommodate all work.\n\n   * PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE\n\n                                                  October 26, 1972\n\n                        UU/CC Rate Schedule\n\n   Code Service                                         Rate\n   -------------------------------------------------------------\n    41   1108 Secs - CPU                           $ .15/sec\n    42   1108 Secs - I/O                             .15/sec\n    40   Demand Terminal connect time               3.00/hr.\n    95   Pages                                       .03/page\n    31   Pages - Remote Station                      .00/page\n    96   Cards in                                    .0005/card\n    32   Cards in - Remote Station                   .00/card\n    97   Cards out                                   .006/card\n    33   Cards out - Remote Station                  .000/card\n    98   Tape Mounts                                 .45/tape\n    81   Gerber Plotter                              .0025/inch\n    73   Mass Storage                                .04/trk/day\n    70   Calma Digitizer                            5.00/hr.\n    90   Paper Tape Plot                           30.00/hr.\n    17   Optical Scanner                             .02/page\n    91   Misc.
