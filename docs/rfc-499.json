Reussow\nRequest for Comments: 499    Center for Research in Computing Technology\nNIC: 15716                                            Harvard University\n                                                            April 1 1973\n\n                         HARVARD'S NETWORK RJE\n\nSection I\n\n   RJE was designed to provide network users with the facility of\n   submitting jobs to remote servers via the ARPA net and retrieving\n   results using Harvard's PDP-10.\n\n   In order to be an expert in the use of the RJE program from a remote\n   host, the user must be familiar with the FTP commands and usage.  At\n   present RJE is only implemented for UCLA.  Accordingly, all examples\n   will deal with the UCLA installation.  Arrangements for a password\n   and a job ID must be made at UCLA before usage is to begin.  If you\n   are interested, we will see to it that an account is made up for you.\n   People at other sites should deal directly with UCLA to get an\n   account.\n\nSection II\n\n                         HOW TO USE RJE AT HARVARD\n\n   Start the program by taping R RJE\u003cCR\u003e at monitor level.  RJE will\n   respond with a \"!\".\n\n   Then type \"RJE UCL\u003cCR\u003e to make the TELNET connection.  The TELNET\n   connection is used for transfer of commands to UCLA and error\n   messages from UCLA to the user of RJE.  It is important to realize\n   that, in using RJE, one is talking to two systems; the local system\n   (HARV-10) and the remote host where the job will actually be run.\n   Therefore, there are two command processors, one local and one\n   foreign.\n\n                  COMMANDS TO THE LOCAL (HARVARD) PROCESS\n\n   All commands to the local process begin with a *.\n\n   *READ LDEV:FILENAME.EXTENSION\u003cCR\u003e\n\n   Reads the specified file, which contains all job cards, JCL, program\n   and data, formats it for RJS at UCLA and ships it over a data\n   connection.  When using the data connection, ASCII files are\n   translated into EBCDIC, the UCLA end of the connection.  After\n   transfer is completed the file is immediately spooled for processing.\n\n\n\nB. Reussow                                                      [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 499                  HARVARD'S NETWORK RJE              April 1 1973\n\n\n   *PRINT LDEV:FILENAME.EXTENSION\u003cCR\u003e\n\n   Gets the next print file from UCLA's 91 and reformats the print file\n   for a PDP-10 line printer.  Write the file to the user's specified\n   logical device with the specified FILENAME.EXTENSION.  FILENAME is up\n   to 6 characters in length and EXTENSION is up to 3 characters in\n   length.\n\n   *QUIT\u003cCR\u003e\n\n   Tear down all connections used by RJE and return to monitor level.\n\n                      COMMANDS TO THE REMOTE PROCESS\n                            (UCLA RJS COMMANDS)\n\n   Commands to the remote process have no special character preceding a\n   command.  For a explanation of the command arguments, ask Terry Sack\n   for the document named, RJS OPERATOR COMMANDS FOR REMOTE TERMINALS.\n\n   Terminal Control and Information Command\n   -------- ------- --- ----------- -------\n\n   SIGNON              First command of a session identifies VRBT\n                       (virtual remote batch terminal) by giving its\n                       terminal ID.  For UCLA, Harvard's terminal ID is\n                       NETHARV.\n\n   SIGNOFF             Last command of a session; RJS waits for any data\n                       transfer in progress to complete and then closes\n                       all connections.\n\n   STATUS              Outputs on the local user's terminal a complete\n                       list, or a summary, of all jobs in the system for\n                       this VRBT, with an indication of their\n                       progressing status in the Model 91.\n\n   ALERT               Outputs on the user's terminal any special\n                       \"Alert\" message from the CCN computer operator.\n                       The Alert message is also automatically sent when\n                       the user does a SIGNON, or whenever the message\n                       changes.\n\n   MSG                 Sends a message to CCN computer operator or to\n                       any other RJS terminal (real or virtual).  A\n                       message from the computer operator or another RJS\n                       terminal will automatically appear on the user's\n                       terminal.\n\n\n\n\nB. Reussow                                                      [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 499                  HARVARD'S NETWORK RJE              April 1 1973\n\n\n   Job Control and Routing Commands\n   --- ------- --- ------- --------\n\n   Under CCN's job management system, the default destination for output\n   is the input source.  Thus, a job submitted under a given VRET will\n   be returned to that VRBT (i.e., the same terminal ID), unless the\n   user's JCL overrides the default destination.\n\n   RJS places print and punch output destined for a particular remote\n   terminal into either an Active Queue or a Deferred Queue.  When the\n   user opens his print or punch output channel (via the *PRINT command\n   of RJE), RJS immediately starts sending job output from the Active\n   Queue, and continues until this queue is empty.  Job output in the\n   Deferred Queue, on the other hand, must be called for by job name\n   (via a RESET command from the remote operator) before RJS will send\n   it.  The Active/Deferred choice for output from a job is determined\n   by the deferral status of the VRBT when the job is entered; the\n   deferral status, which is set to the Active option when the user\n   signs on, may be changed by the SET command.\n\n   SET                 Allows the remote user to change certain\n                       properties of his VRBT for the duration of the\n                       current session\n\n                       (a) May change the default output destination to\n                       be another (real or virtual) RJS terminal or the\n                       central facility.\n\n                       (b) May change the deferral status of the VRBT.\n\n   DEFER               Moves the print and punch output for a specified\n                       job or set of jobs from the Active Queue to the\n                       Deferred Queue.  If the job's output is in\n                       process of being transmitted over a channel, RJS\n                       aborts the channel and saves the current output\n                       location before moving the job to the Deferred\n                       Queue.  A subsequent RESET command will return it\n                       to the Active Queue with an implied Backspace\n                       (BSP).\n\n   RESET               Moves specified job(s) from Deferred to Active\n                       Queue so they may be sent to user.  A specific\n                       list of job names or all jobs can be moved with\n                       one RESET command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Reussow                                                      [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC 499                  HARVARD'S NETWORK RJE              April 1 1973\n\n\n   ROUTE               Re-routes output of specified jobs (or all jobs)\n                       waiting in the Active and Deferred Queues for\n                       this VRBT.  The new destination may be any other\n                       RJS terminal or the central facility.\n\n   ABORT               Cancels a job which was successfully submitted\n                       and awaiting execution or is currently executing\n                       in the Model 91.  If the cancelled job was in\n                       execution, all output it produced will be\n                       returned.\n\n   Output Stream Control Commands\n   ------ ------ ------- --------\n\n   BSP (BACKSPACE)     Backspaces output stream within current SYSOUT\n                       data set.  Actual amount backspaced depends upon\n                       SYSOUT blocking but is typically equivalent to a\n                       page on the line printer.\n\n   CAN (CANCEL)        (a) On an output channel, CAN causes the rest of\n                       the output in the SYSOUT data set currently being\n                       transmitted to be omitted.  Alternatively, may\n                       omit the rest of the SYSOUT data sets for the job\n                       currently being transmitted; however, the\n                       remaining system and accounting messages will be\n                       sent.\n\n                       (b) On an input channel, CAN causes RJS to ignore\n                       the job currently being read.  However, the\n                       channel is not aborted as a result, and RJS will\n                       continue reading in jobs on the channel.\n\n                       (c) CAN can delete all SYSOUT data sets for\n                       specified job(s) waiting in Active or Deferred\n                       Queue.\n\n   RST (RESTART)       (a) Restarts a specified output stream at the\n                       beginning of the current SYSOUT data set or,\n                       optionally, at the beginning of the job.\n\n                       (b) Marks as restarted specified job(s) whose\n                       transmission was earlier interrupted by system\n                       failure or user action (e.g., DEFER command or\n                       aborting the channel).  When RJS transmits these\n                       jobs again, it will start at the beginning of the\n                       partially transmitted SYSOUT data set or,\n                       optionally, at the beginning of the job.  This\n                       function may be applied to jobs in either the\n\n\n\nB.

If the job was never\n                       transmitted, RST has no effect other than this\n                       queue movement.\n\n   REPEAT              Sends additional copies of the output of\n                       specified jobs.\n\n   EAM                 Echoes the card reader stream back in the printer\n                       or punch stream, or both.\n\nSection III\n\n                       USE OF RJE FROM A REMOTE HOST\n\n   To use RJE from a remote Host, make a TELNET connection to Harvard's\n   10 via your TELNET program.  Login under one of Harvard's guest\n   accounts: type LOGIN \u003cCR\u003e.  LOGIN will prompt you with a #.  When it\n   does, type 62,# \u003cCR\u003e.  Answer all questions that are asked.\n\n                        USING FTP TO TRANSFER FILES\n\n   Prompts:\n\n   \"*\"     Prompt from FTP when no network connections are established.\n\n   \"!\"      Prompt when network connections are open.\n\n   Type R FTP\u003cCR\u003e, then type 'Host host # or abbreviation' \u003cCR\u003e to set\n   up a TELNET connection.  The local FTP process will then type the\n   foreign host's greeting message.\n\n   If transferring files to or from other than a PDP-10, type the\n   commands 'TYPE A' and 'BYTE 8', each followed by a carriage return.\n\n   !USER 'Your project, programmer number'\u003cCR\u003e\n         Tell the server who you are.  The USR command should be the\n         first command to FTP.\n\n   !RETRIEVE FILENAME.EXTENSION \u003cCR\u003e\n         Retrieve a file from the foreign host.  After the message\n         \"transfer completed\" has been typed, use the QUIT command.\n\n   !QUIT\u003cCR\u003e\n         Break connections return to monitor level.  After you have\n         transfered your files consult Section II for the usage of RJE.\n\n\n\n\nB.

If\n   you plan to use another type of printer, special arrangements will\n   have to be made.\n\n   Also, never leave a file on Harvard's disk area when detached.  A\n   detached job is a job to which no terminal is assigned.  You may find\n   that your file is gone when you come back.  We have limited disk\n   resources and, if a crisis arises, files belonging to detached jobs\n   are subject to deletion.\n\n\n         [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n               [ into the online RFC archives by Via Genie]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB.
