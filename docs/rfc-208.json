McKenzie\nRequest for Comments: 208                        Bolt Beranek and Newman\nNIC: 7181                                                  9 August 1971\nCategories: B.l, C.2\nUpdates: none\nObsoletes: none\n\n\n                             ADDRESS TABLES\n\n   Attached is a copy of a revision to Appendix A of BBN Report No.\n   1822; the revised version of the Appendix is our first attempt to\n   make the list of sites attached to the ARPA Network prospective\n   rather than retrospective.  We are adopting this approach because of\n   the large number of sites scheduled for attachment in the near\n   future, and because many Hosts apparently require a site's address to\n   be in some local table before their NCPs will permit communication\n   with the site.  Therefore, we urge such Hosts to add the new sites to\n   their lists of addresses as soon as possible.  Also, please note the\n   address change which will be made at BBN on exactly September first.\n\n   Incidentally, it seems to us that it is irrational for an NCP to\n   discard otherwise valid messages, simply because the sender's address\n   doesn't appear in a local table.  Similarly, it seems almost as\n   irrational for an NCP to prevent a local user from trying to\n   communicate with a remote site, the address of which is known to the\n   user but not stored in the NCP's tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKenzie                                                        [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 208                      Address Tables                9 August 1971\n\n\nReport No. 1822                             Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nIMP AND HOST SITE IDENTIFICATION\n\n   Bit 9-16 of the leader of most Host-to-IMP or IMP-to-Host messages\n   define a network address related to the message (these bits are not\n   meaningful for message types 1, 2, and 4).  In a Host-to-IMP message\n   the network address identifies a particular Host to which the message\n   should be delivered.  In an IMP-to-Host message the network address\n   identifies the Host from which the message originated.\n\n   A network address consists of six bits (bits 11-16 of the leader)\n   which specify an IMP number, preceded by two bits (bits 9-10 of the\n   leader) which specify the Host number of a particular Host connected\n   to that IMP.  The table below gives the decimal values of IMP number,\n   Host number, and network address for each Host currently connected to\n   the ARPA Network or scheduled for connection in the near future.\n   Scheduled installation dates are also shown for Hosts not currently\n   connected; these dates, however, are subject to change without\n   notice.\n\n    IMP      SITE     HOST                    NETWORK    SCHEDULED\n   NUMBER    NAME    NUMBER       HOST        ADDRESS   INSTALLATION\n   ------    ----    ------       ----        -------   ------------\n     1       UCLA      0       SIGMA-7           1\n                       1       IBM 360/91       65\n     2       SRI       0       PDP-10 (NIC)      2\n                       1       PDP-10 (Al)      66\n     3       UCSB      0       IBM 360/75        3\n     4       UTAH      0       PDP-lO            4\n     5       BBN       0       DDP-516           5  )   See Note 1\n                       1       PDP-10 (A)       69  )\n                       2       PDP-1O (B)      133\n\n   Note 1: Prior to September 1, 1971 the BBN PDP-1O (A) will be Host\n   number 0 (network address 5) and the BBN DDP-516 will be Host number\n   1 (network address 69).
