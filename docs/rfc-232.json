Vezza\n                    September 23, 1971\n\n\n     At the last Network Graphics meeting held in July at\n\nM.I.T., we tentatively scheduled the next Network Graphics\n\nmeeting which is being hosted by Stanford AI, for October\n\n17, 18, and 19.  Because the Network Working Group meeting\n\nis being held on October 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 it has been\n\ndecided to postpone the Network Graphics meeting.  As soon\n\nas a new date for the meeting is established it will be\n\nannounced via an RFC.  It is expected that the meeting will\n\nbe held in the San Francisco area sometime in November or\n\nearly December.\n\n\n\n\n[ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n[ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n[ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
