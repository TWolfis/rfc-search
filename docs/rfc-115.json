North\nNIC 5822                              Stanford Research Institute (ARC)\n                                                          16 April 1971\n\n     SOME NETWORK INFORMATION CENTER POLICIES ON HANDLING DOCUMENTS\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n   The Network Information Center (NIC) seeks to facilitate the flow of\n   information between sites on the Network and to and from other\n   stations whose work makes them valuable as participants in the\n   Network dialog.  The NIC is concerned both with the techniques for\n   the flow and with optimizing the content of the information itself.\n   Some aspects of the work of the NIC in support of information flow\n   are described here, and some suggestions made to Network participants\n   of ways they can help this work.\n\n   All information handled by the NIC is available to any Network\n   participant.  All information generated by the NIC is unclassified\n   and is without distribution limitation except as dictated by staff\n   and budget size.  Any information sent by an originating party to the\n   NIC for recording or distribution is presumed to be unclassified and\n   without distribution limitations as well.  Any statement carried by a\n   document thus submitted which seems to imply a limitation on\n   distribution, quotation, or citation is presumed not to apply to its\n   handling by the Network Information Center.\n\nNIC NUMBER\n\n   One important function of the Network Information Center is to make\n   records of the existence of RFC's, formal NIC-related manuals and\n   reports, Network memos, other Network informational items, and other\n   informational items of interest to Network participants, and to index\n   these records so that such items can be recalled when needed.\n\n   To tag the informational items a serial number is assigned by NIC.\n   The serial number has no intrinsic meaning, not even necessarily an\n   indication of sequence of issue.  It is a unique identifier and can\n   be used to refer to the item in further communications, to facilitate\n   indexing, and to allow numeric filing of documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatson \u0026 North                                                  [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 115              Policies on Handling Documents        16 April 1971\n\n\n   Use of the NIC number has advantages in online dialog which are not\n   yet demonstrable around the Network, but the cooperation of Network\n   participants in applying one when a document is originated is\n   important.\n\nTHE NIC CATALOG\n\n   Items of information relevant to the Network appear in many forms,\n   including technical reports, RFC's, brief network memos, journal\n   articles, and letters.  Reference to these is simplified by\n   assignment of a NIC number to each.  To record the item to which the\n   NIC number refers, a description of each item, using a set of\n   standard data elements, i.e, author, title, etc., is coded and\n   entered as an online system (NLS) statement into a machine file.\n\n   An example of a statement with typical coded data elements:\n\n         (A5480) *a1 James E.

The\n   term NIC Catalog refers to the machine file created by collecting the\n   statements coded *z2 NIC in the Master Catalog.\n\n   The data element *z1 indicates which Stations hold a copy of an item;\n   not all items related to NIC are sent to Stations, and in the future\n   it is expected that Stations will submit many documents to NIC for\n   cataloging which are not held by other Stations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatson \u0026 North                                                  [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 115              Policies on Handling Documents        16 April 1971\n\n\nNIC CATALOG LISTINGS AND INDEXES\n\n   Programs have been written at ARC to collect, sort, analyze and\n   format the statements and the data elements in the statements to\n   produce catalogs and indexes such as those in the Current Catalog of\n   the NIC Collection, NIC (5145,).\n\n   The Current Catalog of the NIC Collection is a functional document,\n   as explained in Branch 3 below.  It has as its contents, at any time,\n   the current issue of a bibliography of items from the NIC Catalog,\n   called a NIC Catalog Listing, and author and keyword indexes.\n\n   Examples of entries in the Catalog Listing and in indexes are shown,\n   using the statement above:\n\n      Catalog Listing by Author:\n\n         An NCP for the ARPA Network\n\n              James E.

A number catalog or index serves as a shelf list of\n   documents held by a Station.  The indexes are not limited to the\n   Station Collections but lead to the entire Catalog.\n\nDATA ELEMENTS\n\n   The data elements for information items include the author, title,\n   addressee, date, other numbers, keywords, and abstract.  When these\n   elements do not exist in the item, they are supplied by a NIC\n   cataloger if possible.  In online communication around the Network,\n   \"online dialog\", several of these elements of data will be recorded\n   automatically.  Lacking online recording, it is important that\n   originators of reports, memos, and other such items be diligent in\n   including these data in their transmissions.\n\n      For memos, essential data elements which the originator\n      should supply are:.\n\n         author(s)\n         address(es) of author(s)\n         addressee(s)\n         address(es) of addressee(s)\n         date of origination\n         subject of memo\n\n         A preassigned NIC number is desirable. A number for\n         assignment can presently be obtained by calling NIC, and\n         soon will be obtainable online.\n\n         The addressees of a memo can of course be a group, such\n         as the Network Working Group, or the Glitch Cleaning\n         Committee, in which case the NIC needs a list or\n         reference to a list of the people in the group.\n\n\n\n\nWatson \u0026 North                                                  [Page 4]\n\f\nRFC 115              Policies on Handling Documents        16 April 1971\n\n\n      For reports and other formal documents, essential data\n      elements are:\n\n         author(s)\n         addresses of author(s)\n         title\n         date\n         abstract\n         keywords\n\n         A short abstract, 150 to 200 words, giving some of the\n         substance of the document is of importance in the NIC\n         record and even for the person about to read the\n         document. Obviously, a well-written author abstract is\n         preferable to one produced by the NIC staff.\n\n         Keywords supplied by the author, preferably those from a\n         standard thesaurus, will be used in machine retrieval.\n         When such author-assigned keywords are lacking, the NIC\n         will supply some. Recommended sources for keywords are:\n\n            Categories identified by Peggy Karp, Categorization\n            and Guide to NWG/RFC's.

NIC\n            5828.\n\n     When a document being issued supercedes an earlier\n     document, this information is particularly important, and\n     should be supplied by the author.\n\nSUBCOLLECTIONS\n\n   Groups of documents, such as the NWG/RFC's and the replies to Sher's\n   survey, as well as the Station Collections, are cataloged by NIC as\n   subcollections.  That is, they are retrievable as a subset of the NIC\n   Catalog, which in turn is a subset of a Master Catalog at ARC.  The\n   capability of making subcollections is provided for Network\n   participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatson \u0026 North                                                  [Page 5]\n\f\nRFC 115              Policies on Handling Documents        16 April 1971\n\n\n      To create a subcollection in the NIC records, a Network\n      participant will be able to indicate to NIC the records he wishes\n      to have so grouped, and this information will be entered in the\n      Master Catalog statement for the document, for later retrieval.\n\nFUNCTIONAL DOCUMENTS\n\n   Several documents generated in Network activities are subject to\n   occasional revision and updating.  The NIC Catalog, the Directory of\n   Network Participants, and the Directory of Network Resources are\n   examples.  These and external documents such as the BBN manuals are\n   referred to by NIC as \"functional documents\".\n\n      More generally, a functional document is a document whose title\n      and function remain constant, but whose contents can change.  A\n      functional document contains a single or several documents which\n      can be added to, deleted, or replaced entirely or selectively.\n      Thus the functional document, which has a NIC number, can be\n      referenced in other documents with some assurance that it will be\n      in existence, even though the subdocuments with their distinctive\n      NIC numbers may be in flux.  In the Catalog, the number of a\n      functional document in which a specific document may be contained\n      is listed, and the current contents of each functional document is\n      indicated.\n\n      In preparing a document which is expected to be revised, Network\n      participants are urged to use a looseleaf format.\n\n   The Network Information Center intends to support the distribution\n   and recording of contents of functional documents.  Procedures have\n   been established, as described below, for fitting the changes to such\n   documents into the NIC system, and for reproducing and distributing\n   them to individuals or stations with instructions for their\n   integration into the existing documents.\n\nPROCEDURES FOR REVISION MATERIAL\n\n   Original manuals and other functional document materials are\n   reproduced and distributed by NIC just as other Network publications.\n   For all documents obtained through NIC, NIC will attempt to receive\n   and make distribution of updates.\n\n   NIC also wants to make the processes of inserting the revisions and\n   of recording the changes as easy and foolproof as possible.  The user\n   should not only be given the current materials, but should be able to\n   determine the version he holds, and to be able to refer to updates\n   uniquely.  The following is copied from the procedure instructions\n\n\n\n\nWatson \u0026 North                                                  [Page 6]\n\f\nRFC 115              Policies on Handling Documents        16 April 1971\n\n\n   NIC has written for its own use.  These procedures are also\n   recommended to Network participants for their use in preparing\n   revision material to be sent to NIC.\n\n   Update conventions\n\n      Substantial revision of a bound document, or of more than a few\n      pages of a loose leaf document:\n\n         A new document will be published, with a new NIC number,\n         and will bear a notation under the number on the title\n         page and/or cover, e.g.,\n\n            NIC 5772\n            supercedes NIC 5621\n\n         Few pages inserted or revised in a looseleaf or\n         corner-stapled document:\n\n            Each new or revised page will bear the original document\n            number, with a notice of revision, e.g.,\n\n               NIC 5742\n               3-10-71\n\n            Inserted pages will be numbered to fit into the existing\n            document, e.g., pages 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, may be inserted\n            between pages 5 and 6.\n\n            Deleted pages will be replaced by a single page\n            indicating the deletion, e.g.,\n\n               Pages 7-12 deleted, 3-25-71\n\n         A new table of contents and/or title page will be issued\n         bearing the revision notice. In addition, at the time of\n         each revision a page or pages will be prepared and\n         issued which indicates all additions, deletions, and\n         revisions which bring the document up to date.\n\n      Revisions will be made only by substitution, addition or deletion\n      of a full page or more.  NIC will not revise its own publications\n      by lists of errata, and strongly recommends against their use by\n      others in the Network.  However, when NIC receives such lists of\n      errata, it will reproduce and distribute them with suggestions to\n      Station Agents for recording and inserting them.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatson \u0026 North                                                  [Page 7]\n\f\nRFC 115              Policies on Handling Documents        16 April 1971\n\n\n   Distribution and transmittal procedures\n\n      The transmittal letter accompanying a set of revision material and\n      the revision material itself constitute a separate document, a\n      copy of which is filed at NIC, where a new copy can be provided at\n      any time.\n\n      The transmittal letter will indicate the appropriate information;\n      document number of the revision material, date, document number of\n      the publication being updated, its date, and, when practicable,\n      information on the changes made in the text.\n\n   Revision notation in the printed Catalogs and their indexes\n\n      Catalog entry\n\n         Supercession\n\n            The data element containing \"superceded by NIC xxxx\"\n            will be formatted to appear at the beginning of the\n            citation of the superceded document.\n\n            The data element containing \"supercedes NIC xxxx\"\n            will be formatted to appear following the abstract in\n            the citation.\n\n         Partial revision\n\n            The data element containing the note of revision will\n            be formatted to appear following the abstract.\n\n      Entries in author, titleworld, or other indexes\n\n         Supercession\n\n            The data element covering supercession will be the\n            only text in the entry for the superceded document.\n\n            Supercession will not be indicated in the entry for\n            the superceding document\n\n         Partial revision\n\n            Partial revision will not be indicated in the index\n            entry\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n          [ into the online RFC archives by Jay Kominek 2/99 ]\n\n\n\nWatson \u0026 North                                                  [Page 8]\n\f\n"
