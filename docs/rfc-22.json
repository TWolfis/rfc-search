In\n   the meantime, it seems important to report a new control message\n   format which does not use 7-bit ASCII character mode of transmission.\n\n   All Host-Host control messages consist of sequences of 8-bit bytes of\n   the form:\n\n   \u003ccontrol byte\u003e \u003cparameter byte l\u003e ... \u003cparameter byte n\u003e\n\n   It is reasonable to transmit more than one control message in any\n   given packet, although this is not mandatory.\n\n   Presently, 9 control messages have been defined by UCLA; these are\n   given in the table below along with their parameters.  The\n   interpretation is given from the point of view of the transmitting\n   host. (\"L\" or \"Li\" mean Link#, and are binary values.)\n\n   Control byte     Parameter      Interpretation\n\n    \u003c0\u003e             \u003cL\u003e           Please establish primary connection;\n                                  our output link # is L\n\n    \u003c1\u003e             \u003cL,\u003e \u003cL2\u003e     Please establish auxiliary connection\n                                  parallel to our primary output link L.\n                                  The auxiliary output link is L2.\n\n    \u003c2\u003e             \u003cL1\u003e \u003cL2\u003e     DK primary.
