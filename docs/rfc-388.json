The results will be\n   published monthly as Network Measurement notes and as RFC's.  We will\n   periodically open a connection on your local socket @241 (decimal),\n   expecting you to send the following data in the format shown:\n\n                   \u003cduplicate pages 3-5 of RFC 323 here\u003e\n\n      a. Total bits sent to HOST\n      b. Total bits received from HOST\n      c. Total messages sent to HOST\n      d. Total messages received from HOST and optionally\n      e. Average Round Trip delay on send connections to HOST\n\n   The information above should be collected only for standard open\n   connections (i.e. those using standard NCP protocol) and not\n   measurement links or experimental NCP links, and in particular, not\n   traffic on link 0).\n\n   Another optional measurement would be to gather the distribution of\n   message types over link 0 over all HOSTS (i.e. not broken down by\n   HOST). This will reveal the relative utilization of control messages\n   (ALLOC should be very prevalent).\n\n   The data collected for the last 24 hour sample period should be\n   available from a process listening on local socket number 241 (10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCerf                                                            [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 388                      NCP Statistics                  August 1972\n\n\n                        16         16\n                 +----------+------------+\n   word 0        |  Day #   |  Time      |\n                 +----------+------------+\n                    |            |\n   1 - 365 (6 on leap year)      |______\n                                        |\n                            Time in minutes at which sample was\n                         started.
