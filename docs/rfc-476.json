First, the\nretrofits to Utah, Belvoir, NOAA, USC, Stanford, ISI, Case, and CCA have\nbeen completed and are therefore removed from the schedule.  Second, the\nretrofits to UCSB, ETAC, Aberdeen, and Rome have been rescheduled.\n\nThe revised text of RFC #447 follows:\n\nDuring the first several months of 1973 we will be retrofitting each IMP\nand TIP with additional core memory.  At the end of the retrofit\nprogram, the memory sizes of the various machines will be as follows:\n\n    IMP (516 or 316) - 16K words\n\n    TIP - 28K words\n\n    TIP with Magnetic Tape Option - 32K words\n\nIn addition, the expansion of the TIP core memory will necessitate\nenlarging the TIP to two cabinets.\n\nListed below is the schedule for the remaining retrofits.  We have\narranged this schedule to coincide with the usual monthly Preventive\nMaintenance at each site so as to minimize user inconvenience, but the\nwork required will frequently require the machines to be down longer\nthan normal.  I will issue additional RFC's updating this schedule as\nnecessary.\n\nAny site which anticipates difficulty with the expansion of TIP size,\nand thus the floor space requirement, should contact Hawley Rising (BBN)\nat\n    (617)491-1850 ext. 473\nAll dates given below are below in the form (month/day)\n\n    SRI (3/7)\n    ETAC (3/15)\n    FNWC (3/15\n    Rome (3/16)\n    UCLA (3/19)\n    AMES IMP (3/21)\n    GWC (3/22)\n\n\n\nMcKenzie                                                        [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 476         IMP/TIP Memory Retrofit Schedule (Rev 2)      March 1973\n\n\n    Carnegie (4/4)\n    SDC (4/17)\n    Illinois (4/18)\n    UCSB (5/1)\n    Aberdeen (postponed indefinitely)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with    ]\n       [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.             9/99 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKenzie                                                        [Page 2]\n\f\n"
