Due to hardware debugging, the BBN\nprototype Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) was unavailable for most\nof the two weeks from November 22 to December 6. There was, therefore,\nno Host status reports for that period.\n\n     Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.\nThese Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n   1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on\n      the Network as servers (available for use from\n      other sites) on a regular basis for at least two\n      weeks. Included here are:\n\n   Network\n   Address              Site                Computer\n   -------              ----                --------\n\n     133                BBN                 PDP-10 (B)\n      71                Rand                PDP-10\n      13                Case                PDP-10\n      15                Ames/(Paoli)        ILLIAC/(B6500)\n      16                Ames                IBM-360/67\n\n   2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.\n      Included here are the Terminal IMPs, which are\n      presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN*).\n      This category also includes the Network Control Center\n      Computer (Network Address 5) which is used solely for\n      gathering statistics from the Network. Finally,\n      included among these Hosts are the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n   Network\n   Address              Site                Computer\n   -------              ----                --------\n\n       7                Rand                IBM-360/65\n      73                Harvard             PDP-1\n      12                Illinois            PDP-11\n      19                NBS                 PDP-11\n\n     The NBS Terminal IMP (Network Address 147) was installed in\nWashington at the beginning of December.\n\n     The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this\nperiod.\n\n----------------\n* The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\nsuch is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used\nto refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\nNETWORK\nADDRESS SITE          COMPUTER           DAY, DATE AND TIME (EASTERN)\n------- ----          --------           ----------------------------\n                                      M      Tu       W      Th       F\n                                    12/6    12/7    12/8    12/9    12/10\n                                    1300    1700    1300    1300    1630\n\n   1    UCLA          SIGMA-7         D       O       O       H       T\n\n *65    UCLA          IBM-360/91      H       H       D       H       H\n\n   2    SRI (NIC)     PDP-10          D       T       D       D       D\n\n  66    SRI (AI)      PDP-10          D       D       D       D       D\n\n   3    UCSB          IBM-360/75      O       D       O       R       D\n\n   4    UTAH          PDP-10          T       D       D       D       T\n\n  69    BBN           PDP-10          D       D       D       D       T\n\n   6    MIT (Multics) H-645           O       O       O       T       O\n\n  70    MIT (DM)      PDP-10          O       O       D       D       O\n\n   8    SDC           IBM-360/67     #D      #D      #D      #D      #D\n\n   9    HARVARD       PDP-10          D       T       D       O       D\n\n  10    LINCOLN LAB   IBM-360/67      D       D       D       D       H\n\n  74    LINCOLN LAB   TX2             D       D       D       D       D\n\n  11    STANFORD      PDP-10          D       D       D       D       D\n\n  14    CARNAGIE      PDP-10          D       D       O       D       D\n\nwhere\nD = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to network\n    partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal IMP.)\nH = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either\n    immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)\nO = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to\n    users.)\nR = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)\nT = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a\n    connection within 60 seconds.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 3]\n\f\nNETWORK\nADDRESS SITE          COMPUTER           DAY, DATE AND TIME (EASTERN)\n------- ----          --------           ----------------------------\n                                      M      Tu       W      Th       F\n                                    12/13   12/14   12/15   12/16   12/17\n                                    1300    1700    1700    1600    1400\n                                    1000    1400    1400    1300    1100\n\n   1    UCLA          SIGMA-7         D      #D       D       O       O\n\n *65    UCLA          IBM-360/91      O      #D       D       O       O\n\n   2    SRI (NIC)     PDP-10          D       D       D       T       O\n\n  66    SRI (AI)      PDP-10          D       D       D       D       D\n\n   3    UCSB          IBM-360/75      T       O       D       O       D\n\n   4    UTAH          PDP-10          D       D       D       D       D\n\n  69    BBN           PDP-10          T       H       H       O       T\n\n   6    MIT (Multics) H-645           O       H       O       D       D\n\n  70    MIT (DM)      PDP-10          D       O       D       O       O\n\n   8    SDC           IBM-360/67     #D      #D      #D      #D      #D\n\n   9    HARVARD       PDP-10          O       D       O       D       T\n\n  10    LINCOLN LAB   IBM-360/67      H       D       H       H       H\n\n  74    LINCOLN LAB   TX2             D       D       D       H       D\n\n  11    STANFORD      PDP-10          D       D       D       D       D\n\n  14    CARNAGIE      PDP-10          D       D       D       D       D\n\n*The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a Network\nJob Service (NETRJS); however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not equipped to\ntest NETJRS.
