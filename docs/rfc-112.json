The\n   information may prove useful as background information to TELNET\n   implementers.\n\n   If errors of interpretation of any sites' answer have occurred,\n   please advise me at the following address so that I may update the\n   chart.\n\n                                         Tom O'Sullivan\n                                         Raytheon Data Systems\n                                         1415 Boston-Providence Turnpike\n                                         Norwood, Massachusetts 02062\n\n   [chart: ARPA Network User Terminal Support.
