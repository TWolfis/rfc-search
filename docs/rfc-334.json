Vint has indicated to us that ARPA\nregards these experiments as extremely important in spite of the\npossibility of lockup; we have therefore agreed to assist with the\nexperiments and scheduled them for May 8.\n\n     Although we do not know whether these experiments will cause\nlockup, we suggest that sites do not schedule important network work\nfor Monday, May 8. We apologize for the lateness of this announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
