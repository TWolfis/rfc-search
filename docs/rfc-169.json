Crocker -- ARPA/IPT\n\n   The number of networks has grown to the point where not all\n   participants are familiar with each other; more networks are under\n   development. This workshop is intended especially for those\n   manufactureers, users and researchers who have just entered, or are\n   about to enter, the network field.  Presentations are invited on all\n   aspects of computer networks, particularly including user\n   communities, inter-node protocols, terminal and switching equipments,\n   and communications technology.\n\n   Presentations on embryonic systems are especially invited.\n\n\n   Tentative Agenda\n\n   Session I and II -- Description of Specific Systems\n\n   Presentation of specific systems with emphasis on such topics as the\n   aim of the system and scope; the constraints applied by the\n   application; the equipment used; protocols; expected lifetime; etc.\n\n   Session III -- Functional Capabilities - Alan Weis - IBM Research\n\n   This session will discuss such topics as file transmission, the\n   referencing of foreign data sets, remote job entry protocols,\n   resource control, data standards, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrocker                                                         [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 169                    Computer Networks                 27 May 1971\n\n\n   Session IV -- Limitations of Hardware and Software Systems for\n   Networks - Al Irvine - NCR\n\n   Multiplexers, terminals, software systems, and hardware design will\n   be among the topics discussed at this session.\n\n   Panel Session -- Network Management Problems - Einar Stefferud -\n   Consultant\n\n   Participation in the workshop will be by invitation from the program\n   committee and will be limited to 65 persons, in order to facilitiate\n   discussion.  To encourage free discussion of tentative conclusions,\n   no workshop proceedings will be published.  The workshop should\n   stimulate generation of high quality papers for subsequent\n   publications.\n\n   Should you desire to participate in this workshop, please return the\n   attached questionnaire to the program committee prior to 20 July\n   1971.  Be sure to arrange any release required by your organization.\n   A registration fee of $45 includes means and housing.\n\n   Invitations will be mailed to selected participants approximately 15\n   August 1971.

Small number of participants to permit exhaustive discussion:\n\n   2.  Off-the-record proceedings to allow discussion of incomplete and\n       preliminary results:\n\n   3.  Selected mature participants to obviate the need for tutorial and\n       introductory material:\n\n   4.  A carefully defined topic to keep the discussion in focus.\n\n   Off-The-Record Meetings\n\n   To permit discussion of incomplete and tentative results, information\n   at the workshop cannot be published.  Slides or blackboards may not\n   be photographed so the workshop does not constitute disclosure in the\n   sense of the Patent Law.  After the meeting, participants are\n   encouraged to publish significant contributions.\n\n   Selected Participants\n\n   By limiting the workshop to a small number of active workers, mature\n   scientists knowledgeable in the specific area under discussion,\n   formal papers can be displaced by brief opening statements followed\n   by an open discussion.\n\n\n\n\nCrocker                                                         [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC 169                    Computer Networks                 27 May 1971\n\n\n   General Information on IEEE Workshops\n   Page 2.\n\n   Publication of Results\n\n   One measure of the success of a workshop is the resulting publication\n   of research.  While the workshop itself is closed, it should serve as\n   a stimulus to generate a series of high-quality papers for subsequent\n   open meetings.\n\n   Session Organization\n\n   The workshop is divided into four (4) scheduled sessions, each\n   centered on one phase of the problem to be discussed.  Normally, the\n   workshop chairman will assign to each session chairman the task of\n   clarifying the subsidiary questions to be discussed in his session.\n   Each session is divided into \"talks.\" The speakers are designated as\n   discussion leaders.  Most participants at the workshop will be\n   discussion leaders at one of the sessions.  The session chairman will\n   attempt to provide each speaker with the time he requests (within\n   limits).  Normally, five to ten minutes will be allowed for formal\n   presentation, with 15 to 30 minutes reserved for discussion and\n   debate.  In addition, the chairman may include a general discussion\n   period at the end of the session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrocker                                                         [Page 4]\n\f\n"
