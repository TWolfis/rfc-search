Steve suggested that we put\n   out an RFC to alert the network community to this point.\n\n   In RFC 66, it is proposed that an ALL allocate command be sent\n   immediately following an RTS or STR request for connection.  This\n   conflicts with the restriction stated in Protocol Document 1 that an\n   ALL command can be given only for an \"open\" connection.\n\n   To not be required to handle an ALL command before a connection is\n   established is a simplifying restriction that an NCP implementation\n   may take advantage of.  For example, the Multics NCP is currently\n   designed this way.  For this reason, and also because we believe that\n   the NCP protocol should not be changed now except for critical\n   reasons it is felt that the proposed logger protocol should be\n   modified to agree with the existing NCP protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alison De La Cruz  11/00  ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                           [Page 1]\n\f\n"
