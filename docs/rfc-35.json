Some interest has been\nexpressed in a live presentation, so we will host a network meeting on\nTuesday, March 17, at UCLA at 9:00 a.m.  To facilitate interaction,\nplease limit attendance to one programmer from each site.  It is also\nwise to leave the 18th open in case discussion continues.\n\n     The subject of the meeting will be a detailed presentation of the\nnetwork protocol, suitable for implementing unless major flaws are\ndiscovered.  Documentation will be available at the meeting and if not\nobsoleted by the meeting, will be sent out as NWG/RFC on March 20.\n\n     Please call Mrs. Charlotte LaRoche at (213) 825-2543 if you need\nhelp in making arrangements.\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Jochen Friedrich 4/97 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
