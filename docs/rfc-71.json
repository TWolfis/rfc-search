The following protocol will be used at the CCN-Host at UCLA to\nresynchronize flow control.\n\nIf an input error is detected and the NCP can find the intended link\nnumber, it will send a GVB with frac = O to the sending Host and disregard\nfurther incoming messages on that link. When the RET has been received, a\nnew ALL will be sent.\n\nIf the sending Host is not waiting for a RFNM when the GVB arrives, it will\nsend the RET immediately. If it is waiting for a RFNM corresponding to the\nmessage with the error or a RFNM corresponding to a following message, it\nwill send the RET after the RFNM has been received.\n\nIn this way, the receiving Host will know that the link is clear before it\nissues a new ALL.\n\nTS/rb.\n\n\n\n\n     [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n     [ into the online RFC archives by Alexandra Weikert 7/97]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
