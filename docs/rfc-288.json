(On December 24 and December 31 BBN celebrated\n   Christmas and New Year's Day respectively.)\n\n   During these two weeks the Lincoln Labs TX2 (Network Address 112)\n   became a server.\n\n   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These\n   Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n      1)  Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network\n      as servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis\n      for at least two weeks.  Included here are:\n\n      NETWORK            SITE            COMPUTER\n      ADDRESS\n\n      133                BBN             PDP-10 (B)\n      15                 Case            PDP-10\n      13                 Ames/(Paoli)    ILLIAC/(B6500)\n\n      2)  Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included\n      here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network\n      (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN*).  This category also includes the\n      Network Control Center Computer (Network Address 5) which is used\n      solely for gathering statistics from the Network.  Finally,\n      included among these Hosts are the following:\n\n      NETWORK             SITE           COMPUTER\n      ADDRESS\n\n      7                   Rand           IBM-360/65\n      73                  Harvard        PDP-1\n      12                  Illinois       PDP-11\n      19                  NBS            PDP-11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestheimer                                                      [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 288                   Network Host Status               January 1972\n\n\n   * The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\n   such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to\n   refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this\n   period.\n\nSTATUS OR\nNETWORK   SITE         COMPUTER      STATUS OR          PREDICTIONS\nADDRESS                              PREDICTION         OBTAINED FROM\n\n   1      UCLA         SIGMA-7       Server             John Postel\n  65      UCLA         IBM-360/91    Remote Job Service Bob Braden\n                                     (Telnet in April)\n   2      SRI(NIC)     PDP-10        Server             John Melvin\n  66      SRI(AI)      PDP-10        SOON               Len Chaiten\n   3      UCSB         IBM-360/75    Server             Jim White\n   4      UTAH         PDP-10        SOON               Barry Wessler\n  *5      BBN(NCC)     DDP-516       Never              Alex McKenzie\n  69      BBN(TENEX-A) PDP-10        Server             Dan Murphy\n*133      BBN(TENEX-B) PDP-10        Server(Exper.)
