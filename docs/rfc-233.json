It should be recognized that there is a trade-off\nbetween brevity and mnemonicism.  It is our feeling that a good\nset of host call letters can be developed using only four\ncharacters (see Jim White's in RFC #206.)  Each host should\nsuggest its own call letters.  Upper and lower case letters\nshould be used interchangeably.  The following is our currently\nrecommended list:\n\n       Host Number    Name-4            Name-8\n       -----------    ------            ------\n             1          sex             sex-ucla\n             65         ccn             ccn-ucla\n             2          nic             nic-sri\n             66         srai            sri-ai\n             3          ucsb            ucsb\n             4          utah            utah\n             5          bbn5            bbn-516\n             69         bbna            bbn-10x\n             133        bbnb            bbn-x10x\n             6          mult            multics\n             70         dmcg            mit-dmcg\n             134        its             mit-ai\n             7          ra65            rand-65\n             71         ra10            rand-10\n             8          sdc             sdc\n             9          harv            harvard\n             73         har1            harvpdp1\n             137        ha11            harpdp11\n             10         ll67            linc-67\n             74         tx2             linc-tx2\n             11         stan            stanford\n             12         ill             illinois\n             13         case            case\n             14         cmu             cmu\n             15         paol            paoli\n             16         ames            ames-67\n             144        amtp            ames-tip\n             145        mttp            mitretip\n             18         radc            radc\n             146        rdtp            radc-tip\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n             19         nbs             nbspdp11\n             147        nbtp            nbs-tip\n             148        etac            etac\n             21         tink            tink-418\n             22         mccl            mccl-418\n             23         usc             usc-44\n             151        ustp            usc-tip\n             152        gwc             gwc-tip\n             25         ncar            ncar7600\n             153        nctp            ncar-tip\n             158        bbtp            bbn-tip\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\n"
