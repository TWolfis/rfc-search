Many systems\nprovide programs like \"TTYTST\" available over the standard login\nconnection, but there would be no difficulty in creating a server\nconnection (like ECHO) offering just this limited service.  I'm\nsure that it would be useful for new NCPs, as well as statistics\ngathering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n    [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n    [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                      1/97 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
