The ETAC Terminal IMP (Network address 148) was\n   installed during this period.\n\n   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These\n   Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n      1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network\n         as servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular\n         basis for at least two weeks.  Included here are:\n\n         Network\n         Address          Site            Computer\n         -------          ----            --------\n         134              MIT-AI          PDP-10\n          13              Case            PDP-10\n          15              Ames/(Paoli)    ILLIAC/(B6500)\n\n      2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included\n         here are the Terminal IMP's which are presently in the Network\n         (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN).  [The BBN Terminal IMP (Network\n         Address 158) is a prototype and as such is frequently not\n         connected to the Network, but being used to refine and debug\n         the Terminal IMP programs.]  This category also includes the\n         Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is\n         used solely for gathering statistics from the Network.\n         Finally, included among these Hosts are the following:\n\n         Network\n         Address          Site            Computer\n         -------          ----            --------\n          7               Rand            IBM-360/65\n         73               Harvard         PDP-1\n         12               Illinois        PDP-11\n         19               NBS             PDP-11\n\n   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this\n   period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestheimer                                                      [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 319                   Network Host Status                 March 1972\n\n\n                                                          \"STATUS OR\nSITE                                                      PREDICTIONS\"\nADDRESS  SITE          COMPUTER    STATUS OR PREDICTION  OBTAINED FROM\n-------  ----          --------     ------------------- --------------\n   1     UCLA          SIGMA-7      Server #Limited     Jon Postel\n  65     UCLA          IBM-360/91   NETRJS now          Bob Braden\n                                    (Telnet in April)\n   2     SRI(NIC)      PDP-10       Server              John Melvin\n  66     SRI(AI)       PDP-10       \"Soon\"              Len Chaiten\n   3     UCSB          IBM-360/75   Server              Jim White\n   4     UTAH          PDP-10       Server              Barry Wessler\n  *5     BBN(NCC)      DDP-516      Never               Alex McKenzie\n  69     BBN(TENEX-A)  PDP-10       Server              Dan Murphy\n*133     BBN(TENEX-B)  PDP-10       Server(Exper.)
