Meyer, Jr.\nRequest for Comments #82                                MIT Project MAC\nNetwork Information Center #5619                        December9, 1970\n\n\n                         Network Meeting Notes\n\n   The following summary was transcribed from notes I took at three\n   network meetings held in Houston during the 1970 Fall Joint Computer\n   Conference.  Although I have tried to be objective, unavoidably these\n   notes present a biased view of the meetings.  This is due in part to\n   my preoccupation with certain topics and possible misunderstanding of\n   various discussions.  While I have tried to accurately paraphrase the\n   statements of the attendees, the import of some may have been\n   twisted.\n\n                        Attendees of Monday Meeting\n\n   Dick Benjamin                           MITRE\n   Jack Bouknight                          UI-CAC\n   Al Cocanower                            MIRUT\n   Steve Crocker                           UCLA\n   Dough Engelbart                         SRI\n   Richard Greenblatt                      MIT-MAC\n   Eric Harslem                            RAND\n   Frank Heart                             BBN\n   Allen Joseph                            ORNL (Oak Ridge)\n   Peggy Karp                              MITRE\n   William B.

Operational usage of\n      the net- work, as opposed to experiments, depends on its\n      implementation.\n\n   Introductions to all around.\n\n   Crocker: I have an agenda, but want suggestions for topics.\n\n      1)  I will make introductory remarks.\n      2)  I will list topics of concern.\n      3)  Englebart will talk about the Network Information Center\n      4)  I  will review the status of sites.\n\n   Introductory remarks\n\n      1)  ARPA will not pay for the coffee and pastry being served, so\n          please chip in to help me pay for it.\n      2)  I am going to devote full time to network coordination in an\n          official capacity.  My goals are: (a) to build up usability of\n          the network.  (b) to establish protocol levels, (c) ?\n\n   Areas of importance\n\n      1)  Some site of coalition of sites should prepare a method by\n          which a site's NCP could be checked out.\n      2)  Reworking of NCP protocol.  Some issues could be solved\n          better:  (a) error control, (b) flow control, (c) overloading\n          - loosing network states, (d) simplification and relayering of\n          protocol.\n      3)  Telnet system  console interaction, or logger protocol.  How\n          to get into the system and how to get help when in trouble.\n      4)  Documentation of individual hosts.  Network Info Center\n          involved.  Perhaps each site could be provided with a\n          facsimile device.\n      5)  More sophisticated consoles, particularly graphics consoles,\n          to be attached through network.  There should be a working\n          group to formulate and workout a format for handling\n          sophisticated consoles.  There will be a graphics meeting in\n          January in Colorado or Utah.  The price of admission is to\n          write a proposal.  I expect up to 30 people.  I will pick a\n          small subset to develop specifications.\n\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                           [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 82                   Network Meeting Notes             December 1970\n\n\n      6)  Accounting - In the 2nd half of 1971 more sites will come on\n          where accounting is important. (They want to send bills.)\n          Larry Roberts says that there will be a kind of banking system\n          with bills passed around.  Two types of sites: billing sites,\n          and free but limited access research sites.  I see no\n          fundamental problems.  What happens when a research site talks\n          to a billing site? I think it is do-able.\n      7)  Measurements - the network is a tool, but it is also a model\n          that is better than a simulation package.  Various people want\n          to make measurements.  This could be supported by keeping\n          statistics in NCP's What about increasing the NCP's to include\n          these?\n\n   Long: Putting accounting and measuring into NCP's costs space.  Keep\n      additions to a minimum.\n\n   Weissman: What about scheduled availability of various systems?\n\n   Crocker: This has to be coordinated with each individual system\n\n   ?   : What happens to connections when a system goes down?\n\n   Crocker: What about graphics proposals? I will write my own paper as\n      a proposal.  It uses the DEC 340 as a model.  Modes assumes scope\n      system a memory.  Both output-input are included in standards\n      making.  I want a competent protocol to be developed out of the\n      working group.\n\n   Crocker: What about documentation?\n\n   Meyer: Documentation on how to use other systems are a must.  Only\n      this can motivate operational use of the network.\n\n   --: What about putting documents on-line at each site, or at least\n      abstracts.\n\n   Crocker: What sites have documents on-line? (MIT and Harvard) How do\n      the sites feel about keeping documents on some foreign system?\n\n   Crocker: What about reworking the protocol?\n\n   Harslem: We have logged into the UCSB system and are debugging\n      cooperatively.\n\n   Harslem: We are impressed with eliminating marking and padding (per\n      RFC 67).\n\n\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                           [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC 82                   Network Meeting Notes             December 1970\n\n\n   Crocker: We discussed this with the sites.  Most seemed to accept it,\n      but some reservations.  What about changes to the basic protocol.\n      I'm Meyer has something to say.\n\n   Meyer: The position at Project MAC is that at this point we are\n      opposed to changes other than critical fixes.  Time spent on\n      changes is time that won't be spent on developing other necessary\n      and interesting protocols and systems.  And we at Multics have a\n      long lead time for creation and installation of changes.\n\n   Weissman: I prefer to put in changes in one chunk, say at 6 month\n      intervals.  rather than in bits pieces.\n\n   O'Sullivan: Can't current and new systems work simultaneously?\n\n   Crocker: If the changes involve the IMP, no, because all IMPs want to\n      operate the same system.\n\n   Meyer: The feeling at M.I.T. is that to be a success, the network\n      needs desperately to be used operationally.  If another year\n      passes without significant operational use, it might go down the\n      drain.\n\n   --: And documentation is critical towards motivating operational\n      usage.\n\n   Engelbart: Perhaps we should put off graphics several months so as\n      not to delay typewriters.  Typewriters are important.\n\n   --: But would that be sufficiently impressive for DOD people?\n\n   Engelbart: But if it turns out to be a can of worms in two years...\n\n   --: But do the two (typewriters and graphics) development groups\n      interact?\n\n   Vezza and Engelbart: Yes.\n\n   Crocker: Let's hear more about this.\n\n   Harslem: We want to be able to access files.\n\n   Crocker: Then perhaps the graphics effort would dilute typewriter\n      development.  Is it the consensus of this group that we shouldn't\n      have a graphics meeting?\n\n   Vezza: Newcomers should work on graphics, not established people.\n      Prohibit current people form going to this meeting.\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                           [Page 4]\n\f\nRFC 82                   Network Meeting Notes             December 1970\n\n\n   Meyer: That would be very frustrating.\n\n   Benjamin: Why not solicit position papers (but have no meeting).\n\n   Weissman: Character transmission is easier than graphic transmission\n      More experiments needed for graphics.  The lead time for\n      developing a graphic protocol is much longer than for typewriters.\n\n   Vezza: I agree.\n\n   Crocker: There will be more meetings in the next few days to work on\n      problems of getting useful work over the network.\n\n   Intermission\n\n   9:15 PM\n\n   Crocker: Engelbart will speak on Network Information Center.\n\n   Engelbart: NIC grew as an ad hoc thing, with no specific directives\n      from ARPA.  What kinds of things were envisioned? (1)\n      Sophisticated query systems, (2) Basic information about systems\n      at each site.  Everyone feels very vulnerable about the state of\n      documentation at his own site.  Everyone agrees: better documents\n      necessary.  We see ourselves as providing the following services:\n      1) collecting hard-copy material; 2) on-line querying of catalogs\n      and indices of these; 3) giving access to this material.  We\n      decided to go hard copy rather than on-line, perhaps on\n      microfiche.\n\n   Engelbart: As 940 was to be used for the documentation system,\n      expandable as usage increase.  We are switching form a 940 to a\n      10X to better expand service capacity.  Amount of capacity goes up\n      considerably.  This has held up work on other facets.  A conscious\n      gamble.  We are worried about getting of the ground.  We are short\n      on funds for more secondary storage and are interested in using\n      other hosts for tertiary storage.  The cost of implementing the\n      protocol on the 940 was too high for potential gains, so it was\n      given up.  Few sites would be up by January when our 940 was to be\n      shipped out.\n\n   Engelbart: We have created a Network Dialogue System.  This is a\n      network of human agents.  At each site there is: a) technical\n      communications agent (secretary) and b) a technical liaison\n      person.  We are encouraging agents to talk to us and have created\n      \"Enterprise\" phone numbers so they can talk toll free.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                           [Page 5]\n\f\nRFC 82                   Network Meeting Notes             December 1970\n\n\n   Engelbart: We are at first sending out a tiny kit to each agent, a\n      growing collection of network reference information.  One person\n      (agent) at each site is to be trained to handle the set of\n      documents and retrieve information of contact another site's\n      technical liaison.  This involves a public dialogue, keeping a\n      record of the documents passing back and forth.  This is a sort of\n      \"human IMP\" network, structured as follows:\n\n     ________________________________\n    |                                |\n    |              ________________  |\n    |             |   local        | |     one\n    |             |   reference    | | \u003c== site    ____________\n    |             |    material    | |            (            )\n    |             -----------------| |            (            )\n    |                                |         =\u003e (____________)\n    |                                |        ||       \\\\\n    |                                |        ||     Other sites\n    |                                |        ||         \\\\\n    |                  ________      |        ||      ____________\n    | local =====\u003e    |        |================     (            )\n    | users           |  agent |=====|===============(            )\n    |       =====\u003e    |________|     |               (____________)\n    |                                |\n    |________________________________|\n\n\n          1) Master collection has all material.\n          2) Each local collection has a subset considered most useful.\n\n   --: What about restricting access to documents?\n\n   Engelbart: All files are public files in this system.\n\n   Vezza: You can send a private memo rather than use the NIC service.\n\n   Engelbart: The master collection contains books and other documents.\n      Cataloged on-line.  Hard copy stuff can be duplicated.  For\n      information that passes the value test, the service is to store,\n      catalog, index, and provide access to documents.  We will support\n      a number of different terminal.  We are prepared to go a long time\n      with hard copy items, but can establish a hard copy to on-line\n      transcription service for a price.\n\n   Weissman: What about distributing OCR Selectric balls to sites?\n\n   --: Will NIC take what is sent or actively search it out?\n\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                           [Page 6]\n\f\nRFC 82                   Network Meeting Notes             December 1970\n\n\n   Engelbart: More or less what comes our way.  A system will exist in\n      Spring 1971, to allow an agent to insert items into a catalog.\n      The dialogue that goes on will determine which way the data base\n      grows.  We are pretty sure that eventually SRI will have to charge\n      because of many potential users not at primary sites seeking limit\n      resources.\n\n   --: What about an NCP for your 10X.\n\n   Engelbart: If BBN's NCP is ready by February 1971, we'll use it.\n\n   Crocker: How do people get access?\n\n   Engelbart: Each site is registered.  Any person who gets in on a\n      site's account has its access.  We won't worry about accounting\n      until saturation occurs.  We would like to encourage use of the\n      agent system to create and use a survey of resources at each site.\n      Some subgroup should talk about this.\n\n   Crocker: When can people meet to discuss this? (Tomorrow morning)\n\n   Engelbart: We have nice facilities for developing mailing lists,\n      private bibliographies, personnel profiles, but it depends on the\n      interest of the network people.\n\n   Engelbart: Agents have been set up with MIT, UCLA, RAND, UI, Utah,\n      etc.  A good percentage of sites\n\n   Vezza: Many sites are sending out stuff 3rd and 4th class.  Takes too\n      much time.\n\n   Crocker: Site status report.  ILLIAC IV not to be operational until\n      mid-71, on network later (72?).  Other possible sites: RADC, AWS,\n      NCAR.  Currently up: UCSB, RAND.  Imminent (January 71): MIT BBN,\n      Harvard, UCLA, Utah, LL, SDC.  Some percentage by end of year rest\n      in January.\n\n   Heart: A brand new IMP system (major change) goes in tomorrow.  Some\n      more sites are thinking about coming on.  The network will grow\n      consider- ably beyond what's already on board.  We too are\n      interested in site resource information.  No long term interest,\n      but we will put information on paper to help ARPA.\n\n   Crocker: A lot of people are yawning.  What about meeting schedules?\n      During FJCC's? 1 day vs. 2 day meetings? What about dual East and\n      West coast meetings?\n\n                                                          End of Meeting\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                           [Page 7]\n\f\nRFC 82                   Network Meeting Notes             December 1970\n\n\n                               Network Meeting\n                          9:15 AM Tuesday, 11/17/70\n\n   Crocker: Engelbart will talk in more detail.  Later may discuss\n      logger protocol and file transfer.\n\n   Engelbart: Basic thing is a collection of documents with a catalog to\n      describe it.  Entry has lots of data items, including where to\n      find it.  Techniques for adding and updating entries.  We do it\n      now, but would want to give capability to other sides, partly\n      because we can't determine what's of value. (Displayed 3 types of\n      printout.)  1) Catalog listing, by ordinal index in collection and\n      NIC index.  for inventory control, finding out what's there. 2)\n      Compacted format on one line. 3) Sorted by author-one line per\n      entry.  We Will have procedures where an untrained user can manage\n      a collection.\n\n   Meyer: How are these systems implemented?\n\n   Engelbart: We have a compiler-compiler on the 940.  Our subsystems\n      are written in specialized high level language.  We are moving\n      this over to the 10X.\n\n   Heart: How many people can the 10X support in rough figures?\n\n   Engelbart: Perhaps 100-1000 collections.\n\n   --: Perhaps people could supply own DEC tapes for additional storage.\n\n   Engelbart: Could, but requires on-site operator.  Slow access.  We\n      don't have money for more storage, but are considering shipping\n      files down to UCSB.  We provide on-line querying of on-line data.\n      Willing to worry about data management, whether or not we store\n      it.\n\n   Crocker: Please describe the various subsystems. (Description by\n      Engelbart follows.)\n\n   Heart: Have people tried to use it over the network?\n\n   Engelbart: No.  Don't have an NCP on the 940.  Decided against\n      putting it in a system that is going away.  The biggest hang up is\n      when 10X gets an NCP.  Bobrow developing it, but it is slipping.\n\n   Heart: Who is going to get at it (SRI) early?\n\n   UI: Illinois can access only SRI to begin with.\n\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                           [Page 8]\n\f\nRFC 82                   Network Meeting Notes             December 1970\n\n\n   Postel, UCLA: We plan to use it.\n\n   Heart: Would be a significant task if someone would take it as a goal\n      to get into Engelbart's system.\n\n   MITRE: We're going to use other systems form BBN's 10X.\n\n   Engelbart: We are trying to isolate essential subsystems for people\n      to use easily.  Files are organized hierarchically and will fill\n      out as years go by.  Documents are referenced by pathnames.\n      (Discussion of systems follows.)\n\n   Crocker: Row does one get into the system? (Engelbart describes entry\n      sequence to TOdas.)\n\n   Crocker: How does one get registered on the system?\n\n   Engelbart: Ultimately by personal entry, but currently there is one\n      user id per site.\n\n   Meyer: I think we're ignoring unsolved problems in the typewriter\n      interfacing.  For example, the entry sequence to TOdas, where the\n      user type one or two characters and the system types out the\n      remaining chars of a key word, will be frustrating to use form\n      half-duplex system like Multics.  Our system will not recognize an\n      input line until a new line is typed.\n\n   Various: Discussion of 1/2 duplex communication.  Brings out\n      distinction between a) Full duplex systems where system echoes\n      input vs. 1/2 duplex where input typed locally, and b) systems\n      where each character is recognized as it is typed in vs. systems\n      where entire line is recognized only after EOL char.\n\n   Crocker: Isn't Multics the only half-duplex line-oriented system on\n      the net- work?\n\n   Meyer: I can't believe this.  Don't the IBM systems operate like\n      that?\n\n   Engelbart: We could have a 1/2 duplex interface on our system (SRI).\n      Is it the Multics hardware that enforces this restriction?\n\n   Meyer: Yes, the input-output controller.*\n\n   ______________________________________________\n   *  The Multics IO controller's typewriter adaptor is 1/2 duplex, but\n   can accept break characters other than the \"new line\" character.\n\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                           [Page 9]\n\f\nRFC 82                   Network Meeting Notes             December 1970\n\n\n   Engelbart: Each system should have a preprocessor to talk with other\n      systems.  We're going to put a graphics interface onto the\n      network.\n\n   Meyer: How do you view these interfaces? Do these adhere to some\n      network standard, or ill each system construct an interface to\n      you?\n\n   Engelbart: Standard network protocol.\n\n   Crocker: Let's move on to other things.\n\n   O'Sullivan: What about 2741's on your (CMU) 10X system.  Do you have\n      serious interfacing problems? (CMU's 2741's go through a software\n      package that transforms them into TTY 37's.  No serious\n      difficulty.)\n\n   Various: Brief discussion on how Multics handles input.\n\n   Sundberg, HARVARD: Out 10X can take char-oriented input, but our\n      higher level subsystems prefer line-oriented input.\n\n   --: What about the efficiency of transmitting messages through the\n      network one character at a time?\n\n   Crocker: There is more output, which goes packed, than input, so the\n      input inefficiency is negligible.\n\n   Engelbart: We plan to have several different ports into our system.\n      If each system had an NIC module; it could communicate with us\n      without the necessity of a login.  We prefer a batch-type system,\n      where a site sends spooled batch of edit requests, gets stuff\n      back, and frees ports.  The typewriter transmission by line\n      problem could be handled similar to spooled-up requests.  We\n      encourage spooling, but will support interactive users.  We can\n      support more batch than inter- active people.\n\n   *  The Multics IO controller's typewriter adaptor is 1/2 duplex, but\n   can accept break characters other than the \"new line\" character.\n\n   Vezza: Do people feel that the full and 1/2 duplex issue is a\n      problem? Let all the people go back and find out about this.\n      M.I.T. with a full and 1/2 duplex system 20 feet apart can help\n      here.\n\n   O'Sullivan: There seem to be 2 issues: (1) echoing (full duplex) vs.\n      1/2 duplex. (2) single character vs. full line transmission.\n\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                          [Page 10]\n\f\nRFC 82                   Network Meeting Notes             December 1970\n\n\n   Crocker: Two definitions: Serving host - provides computation; using\n      host - parasitic, manages user's terminal.

I type my input line, then the echoing\n      system responds with my input, then some output.  My system can't\n      filter this because there is no way of differentiating echo from\n      output.\n\n   Crocker: This isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I type command\n      abbreviation to SRI; then next output line is an expanded form of\n      the input command.\n\n   Meyer: Our goal should be one common protocol rather than a bunch of\n      kludgy schemes to implement communication between specific pairs\n      of hosts.\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                          [Page 11]\n\f\nRFC 82                   Network Meeting Notes             December 1970\n\n\n   Long, SDC: We prefer to receive a full line fed through the network.\n\n   Crocker: Let's differentiate between research centers and service\n      centers.  Only the service centers are concerned with a half-\n      duplex interface.  (lower left hand X on chart).  These include\n      SRI, BBN, Multics.\n\n   O'Sullivan: What about research center?\n\n   Crocker: They can call up service centers, but may themselves be hard\n      to use.\n\n   Illinois: Then the ILLIAC IV will have to be half-duplex.\n\n   Postel: I think half-duplex, line-oriented is weaker (than full-\n      duplex, character-oriented protocol).\n\n   Sundberg: Harvard can go either way, but prefer line-oriented system.\n\n   Engelbart: Graphics terminals harder to put on network because of\n      non-standard input.\n\n   Harslem: You're thinking of the keys as function keys rather than\n      input keys.\n\n   Engelbart: I'm worried about people who want to use graphics.\n\n   O'Sullivan: We haven't spoken to the problem of what kind of protocol\n      should be established.\n\n   Crocker: That's not a difficult technical thing.  We'll get to that\n      later and make a decision.\n\n   Meyer: I'm not authorized to make any decision.  I'm to report back\n      to the MAC group.\n\n   Crocker: Okay.  Then, a proposal, to be accepted through the normal\n      mechanism.

The\n      network should be invisible (at this level).\n\n   Vezza, Long: We'll concede, we'll go along.\n\n   Meyer: I'd like to change the restriction.  The last character in the\n      line packet need not be an EOL (as when an output does not advance\n      to a ne line), but an EOL cannot appear in the midst of a packet.\n\n   Van Zoeren: I don't like this restriction.\n\n   Meyer: Count tells us that any EOL is at the end, we need not scan.\n\n   Crocker: The EOL is the character that tells the system to take\n      action.\n\n   Harslem: Our system has 46 function keys, not just one EOL.\n\n   Crocker: How about if C, E {breakset}; i=n.  This s more complex,\n      because have to transmit a breakset.  I'll propose this in a\n      moment.

It's not as\n      bad as you seem to think.\n\n   Engelbart: Upper management should know that it is bad.\n\n   Meyer: That's not clear.  There are efficiency questions.\n\n   Van Zoeren: I don't want to have to transmit files this way.\n\n   Crocker: This is for consoles, not file transmission.\n\n   Engelbart: We need a unified scheme for data transmission.\n\n   O'Sullivan: (For consoles) we're to devise a way to tell a system\n      where its interrupt should be simulated.\n\n   Crocker: There is a general problem of data transmission for tapes\n      and files.\n\n   O'Sullivan: But we have the specific problem of implementing\n      typewriter communications.\n\n   Engelbart: But what we need is a general way of sending stuff through\n      the network (so it is invisible) and have the host interpret it as\n      it wants to.\n\n   Meyer: There should be one console interface for the network, not\n      several at each site.\n\n   Crocker: This problem is perhaps overblown.\n\n   Engelbart, Meyer, O'Sullivan: Discussion about supporting specific\n      terminal types.\n\n   Engelbart: I'll draw a graph of systems vs. terminal type.

Let's\n      have several day meetings at 2-3 month intervals.  We've got a lot\n      of good discussion on the next level protocol.  Let a subgroup\n      work if out.\n\n   (Harslem volunteers to redraft the logger protocol proposed in RFC\n      66.  Meyer will revise proposal in RFC 46.)\n\n   Meyer: Let's go back, discuss these issues, write proposals.  Later\n      we have an open meeting to decide on a formal proposal.\n\n   Crocker: Small group is better, perhaps I'll pick a subset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                          [Page 15]\n\f\nRFC 82                   Network Meeting Notes             December 1970\n\n\n   Vezza: It's true that things aren't settled here.  Major proposals\n      should be on paper preparatory to a meeting.  We can't legislate\n      what a small group does.  It has no more authority than an\n      individual.\n\n   (Karp of MITRE volunteers to produce a bibliography of network\n      documents, perhaps by January.)\n\n   (Who has implemented logger protocol? UCSB and UCLA mod 91 have or\n      are planning.  SDC may have it by 21/1, found it awkward, willing\n      to change.)\n\n   (Discussion of file transmission.  Crocker proposes that a future\n      protocol change might attach a byte size such as 8, 32, 36 bits to\n      a connection.)\n\n   (Regarding control links, everything is transmitted in 8-bit bytes\n      except ECO, ERP, ERR commands, No objection was voiced to changing\n      the protocol so that they also must be multiples of 8-bit bytes.)\n\n   (Discussion of how to specify the end of a file.  Prior transmission\n      of bit count, or send EOR character at end? Suggestion that we\n      want global solution to the general problem of sending an\n      arbitrary length message, rather than just file transmission.)\n\n   (Discussion of \"transaction units\" or record sizes.  What is an\n      optimum transaction unit size? IMP message boundaries are\n      invisible (by protocol fiat) and are not connected with this\n      discussion.  Multics block size was brought up.  Nearest thing is\n      page size, 1024 words.)\n\n   (How to specify end of file.  Engelbart says send data packets, then\n      EOF packet.  Crocker suggests that CLSing connection can act as\n      EOF.  Vezza suggests that IMP message boundaries be used to\n      determine end.  If less than full IMP message, this is last part\n      of file.  Meyer suggests use of two connections, data channel and\n      control channel, over which all control messages, such as file\n      name, bit length, etc. are passed.)\n\n   (Discussion concerning different situations in which whole file, part\n      of the file, or the whole file in arbitrary chunks was wanted.)\n\n   Meyer: Why not defer this, and talk about typewriter communications,\n      which is most critical.\n\n   Vezza: Engelbart wants a clean general solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeyer                                                          [Page 16]\n\f\nRFC 82                   Network Meeting Notes             December 1970\n\n\n   Crocker: If we get an ad hoc solution now, it may interfere with\n      implementing a general solution later.\n\n   (Crocker proposes format for transmitting a file of arbitrary length\n      records of fixed sized bytes of 8-26 bits.
