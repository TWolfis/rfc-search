Until recently all this work\n   has been done from our IBM 360/65 which is only a Network using host\n   (not a server).  Recently our PDP-10 has come onto the Network as\n   both a user and server host.  We now have, as well, a program on the\n   PDP-10 allowing access to the Remote Job Service (RJS) at UCLA.  Our\n   normal mode of operation is diagramed below.\n\n\n                    RAND                                     UCLA\n               ________________                        ________________\n              |    PDP-10      |                      |     360/91     |\n    ______    |                |                      |                |\n   |      |   |   __________   |                      |   __________   |\n   |File  |   |  | RJS      |  |                      |  |          |  |\n   |System|___|__| Access   |__|___/\\/\\ Network /\\____|__|    RJS   |  |\n   |      |   |  | Program  |  |       \\/     \\/      |  |          |  |\n   |______|   |  |__________|  |                      |  |__________|  |\n              |       |        |                      |                |\n              |       |        |                      |                |\n              |_______|________|                      |________________|\n                      |\n                      |\n                    User\n\n   To use RJS the user creates a job source \"deck\" in the Rand File\n   system.  He then instructs the RJS Access Program (RJSAP) to send\n   that file (job) to RJS.  (Sample session below.)  He can then monitor\n   the status of his job via RJSAP (and hence RJS) and ask that RJSAP\n   retrieve his print output to a local file, (or directly to his\n   console, the line printer or whatever).\n\n   Recently, several people at other Network sites have expressed an\n   interest in using RJS.  However, they are located at a minimal Host\n   or at a host not providing RJS access.  Since the Rand PDP-10 is a\n   Network server, these people can solve their access problem by\n   logging onto the Rand PDP-10, using Telnet, and running the RJSAP\n   themselves.  The remainder of this RFC describe the steps necessary\n\n\n\nHarslem                                                         [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 307              Using Network Remote Job Entry        February 1972\n\n\n   to run that program.\n\nThe Rand PDP-10\n\n   The Rand PDP-10 operates under the Tenex operating system.  Thus,\n   some understanding of the Tenex Executive is required.  The necessary\n   documents can be obtained from the developers of Tenex:\n\n                    Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc.\n                    50 Moulton Street\n                    Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138\n                    (617) 491-1850\n\n   Secondly, it is necessary to establish an account on the Rand PDP-10.\n   This can be done through:\n\n                    Rod Fredrickson\n                    The Rand Corporation\n                    1700 Main Street\n                    Santa Monica, California 90406\n                    (213) 393-0411\n\nUCLA Remote Job Service\n\n   To use the UCLA IBM 360/91 via RJS it is necessary to:\n\n      1) have an account at UCLA\n      2) have an assigned RJS terminal ID.\n\n   These can both be obtained from\n\n                    Bob Braden\n                    UCLA\n                    Math Sciences Building\n                    3531 Boelter Hall\n                    Los Angeles, Calif.  90024\n                    (213) 825-7518\n\nThe RJS Access Program (RJSAP)\n\n   A sample session using RJSAP is attached below.  The RJSAP is started\n   by typing \"RJS\u003creturn\u003e\" to the Tenex executive.  The program will\n   then initialize and check (via your login information) to see if you\n   are a user recorded in its tables.  This is done to assure you have a\n   valid RJS terminal ID.  If your ID is not found, the program will\n   terminate with appropriate message.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarslem                                                         [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 307              Using Network Remote Job Entry        February 1972\n\n\n   If your ID is found, RJSAP will attempt to connect to RJS.  If UCLA\n   is down, a message to that effect will appear and the program will\n   terminate.  If UCLA is up, RJSAP will connect you to RJS and sign-on\n   your terminal ID (see RFC 189).  RJSAP will respond \"YOU ARE\n   CONNECTED TO RJS.\"\n\n   At this point RJS will acknowledge your signon and print out messages\n   regarding system status.\n\n   The programs (RJSAP and RJS) are now ready to perform RJE functions.\n   All commands are initially interpreted by RJSAP.  They are listed and\n   explained below.\n\n      1. Help\n\n         If the user types \"?\" RJSAP will echo the \"?\" and list the\n         valid set of commands (see below).\n\n      2. Message to RJS\n\n         If the first character of a command is a \"/\" all subsequent\n         characters up to a \"return\" are transmitted to RJS on the\n         operator input connection.  See RFC 189 for the syntax and\n         semantics of these commands.\n\n         An operator input message can be cancelled with the RUB OUT key\n         or backspaced using BACKSPACE.\n\n      3. Send a Job\n\n         When the user types \"S\" RJSAP echoes \"SEND SOURCE DECK FROM\n         FILE\".  The user then enters the file name containing his job\n         followed by a \"return.\"  Obviously the file must already exist.\n         If the file is ok and is transmitted successfully, both RJSAP\n         and RJS will print an acknowledgement on the user's terminal\n         (see example below).\n\n      4. Retrieve Job Output-Printer\n\n         The user can retrieve printed output by entering \"PR\".  RJSAP\n         will echo \"PRINT OUTPUT TO FILE\".  The user then enters the\n         files name where he wants the output.  This can be a new file\n         or even a device such as the printer or teletype.  When the\n         print output is completely received, the RJSAP will print an\n         acknowledgment (see example).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarslem                                                         [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC 307              Using Network Remote Job Entry        February 1972\n\n\n      5. Retrieve Job Output-Punch\n\n         This function is currently not implemented, pending a decision\n         on the use of this channel between a PDP-10 and a 360.\n\n      6. Transmission Status\n\n         For long transmissions of job input or output it may be\n         desirable to check on the progress of the transmission.  Typing\n         \"R\" will cause RJSAP to echo \"REPORT ON TRANSMISSIONS--\",\n         followed by a record count for the job input and printer output\n         channels.\n\n      7. Termination\n\n         If the user types a \"Q\" at the start of a command, RJSAP will\n         echo \"QUIT IN PROGRESS\" and terminate.  This is the preferred\n         way of terminating the program.  (Rather than just ^C).\n\n   NOTE: Since RJSAP has not been extensively used, we expect it to be\n   improved and modified in the future.  Thus, the last section of this\n   RFC -- the explanation of the use of RJSAP -- will be kept in file\n   \u003cHARSLEM\u003eRJSACCESSPROGRAM.EXPLANATION on the Rand PDP-10 and be\n   updated appropriately.\n\nSample Session\n\n   The follows is a sample session using RJS from RJSAP on the Rand\n   PDP-10.
