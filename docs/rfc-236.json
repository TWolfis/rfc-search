In RFC\n#229, I suggested 8 character names and gave a longer list.  Here I present\nmy list again with some modifications.\n\nI also suggest that as far as possible the Standard host names be consistent\nwith the site names used by the Network Information Center.  It also seems\nto me to be a good idea to consult with each host's technical liaison officer\nbefore assigning that host's name.\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that programmers are lazy and don't like\nto deal with character strings longer than one computer word or containing\ncharacters other than the capital letters A-Z or the digits 0-9.  Thus, I\nhave included an alternate list which is limited to 4 character names using\nonly the alphanumerics.\n\n\n  Site                       Standard Name                       Alternate Name\n  ----                       -------------                       --------------\n\n   1                           UCLA-NMC                            NMC\n   65                          UCLA-CCN                            CCN\n   2                           SRI-ARC                             NIC\n   66                          SRI-AI                              SRAI\n   3                           UCSB                                UCSB\n   4                           UTAH                                UTAH\n   5                           BBN-NCC                             NCC\n   69                          BBN                                 BBN\n   133                         BBN-B                               BBNB\n   6                           MIT-MLTX                            MLTX\n   70                          MIT-DMCG                            DMCG\n   7                           RAND-65                             RAND\n   71                          RAND-10                             RND1\n   8                           SDC                                 SDC\n   9                           HARV-10                             HARV\n   73                          HARV-1                              HRV1\n   137                         HARV-11                             HRV2\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nNetwork Working Group                                          Jon Postel\nRequest for Comments: #236                                     UCLA-NMC\n\n\n                                                               27 September 71\n  Site                       Standard Name                       Alternate Name\n  ----                       -------------                       --------------\n\n   10                          LL-67                               LL67\n   74                          LL-TX2                              TX2\n   11                          SU-AI                               SUAI\n   75                          SU-HP                               SUHP\n   12                          ILL                                 ILL\n   13                          CASE                                CASE\n   14                          CMU                                 CMU\n   15                          BUROUGHS                            BURR\n   16                          AMES-67                             AMES\n   144                         AMES-TIP                            AMET\n   145                         MITR-TIP                            MTRT\n   18                          RADC                                RADC\n   146                         RADC-TIP                            RADT\n   19                          NBS                                 NBS\n   147                         NBS-TIP                             NBST\n   148                         ETAC-TIP                            ETAT\n   21                          TINKER                              OCAF\n   22                          MCLELLAN                            SMAF\n   23                          USC                                 USC\n   151                         USC-TIP                             USCT\n   152                         GWC-TIP                             GWCT\n   25                          NCAR                                NCAR\n   153                         NCAR-TIP                            NCAT\n   158                         BBN-TIP                             BBNT\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\n"
