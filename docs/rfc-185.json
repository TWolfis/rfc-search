For\ngood Network communication, NIC now plans to distribute such\ndocuments to all Station Agents for use as reference copies, to\nLiaisons for their own use, and, when desirable, to outside\nparticipants for understanding of the Network.\n\nThe number of Network participants receiving such distribution is\nnow approaching 80, and with the usual need for additions and\nreplacements, NIC now makes 100 copies of most documents. NIC\ntherefore requests that Network members issuing manuals and other\nlarge working documents assist by providing the necessary 100 copies\nat the time of issuance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n   [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n   [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKreznar                                                         [Page 1]\n\f\n"
