Pyke, Jr.\nRequest for Comments  230                       NBS\nNIC 7647                                        24 September 1971\nCategory: C5\nReference #203\n\n\n                       TOWARD RELIABLE OPERATION\n                OF MINICOMPUTER-BASED TERMINALS ON A TIP\n\n\n\n       The present protocol for communication between a TIP and\nattached terminals requires character-oriented transmission and\nprovides for no error control. In the design of this protocol, it was\napparently assumed that the majority of terminals attached to a TIP\nwould be interactive, be normally used in a character-by-character\nmode both for transmission to and from the terminal, and normally\nsupport a human user who would in effect be in the communication loop.\nThe human user would thus be in a position to detect any significant\ntelecommunication-induced errors both by direct observation of the\ncharacter stream and, more importantly, by examining the computer\noutput in the context of his ongoing interaction.\n\n       The effectiveness of this means for error detection and\ninitiation of corrective measures when necessary is not adequate in\nthe following cases:\n\n     a. For terminal-TIP communication at a medium or\n     higher data rate (say 1200 bps or higher) it is quite possible\n     that the human will skim computer output and not be an\n     effective character-by-character error detector. In\n     particular, when both user input and computer output\n     contain numerical data it is possible that significant\n     undetected errors could occur.\n\n     b. For terminals located at a distance from the TIP\n     and connected either by a private line or the switched\n     network more errors may be introduced than with a\n     terminal local to the TIP (see Note 1). When a large\n     number of user terminals are connected to TIP's through\n     telecommunications facilities, whether within a single\n     organization or, even more likely, when users and user\n     groups not needing the full TIP capability are connected\n     to a remote TIP, this problem may arise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n     c. For terminals containing a substantial amount of logic,\n     including possibly a minicomputer, a human user is very\n     likely not in the direct terminal-TIP communications loop.\n     This case is important, since both alphanumeric and full\n     graphics terminals containing minis are now becoming\n     popular.\n\n     d. An interesting potential application of the network is to\n     provide support for minicomputers used for process\n     control and other laboratory measurement functions. In\n     providing software support for such minis as well as\n     acquiring data from them usually there is no human user\n     in the communication loop.\n\n     e. A number of sites already offer a remote job entry\n     service. Although the present sites assume that the unit\n     record devices such as card readers and line printers are\n     files within a multiprogrammed system at another site, it\n     appears natural that remote batch terminals be attached\n     to the network through TIP's. Here again, there would be\n     no human in the loop between the terminal and the TIP.\n\n       In addition to some degree of error control on these types of\nterminal loops, it may be desirable to provide for block-oriented data\ntransmission, at least for terminals of types (d) and (e) and possibly\n(c) above. It is possible that error control utilizing block\ntransmission can be superimposed on the present TIP-terminal\ncommunication protocol. Data blocks, including error control and block\ndelimiting information, can be multiples of a single character in\nlength. The communication channel would still not be as fully utilized\nas for conventional synchronous block communication, since start and\nstop bits for each character would need to be transmitted. This loss\nis not substantial and does occur now for 2000 bps TIP-terminal\ncommunication.\n\n         There are at least two ways to implement such a protocol on\ntop of the existing TIP-terminal communication protocol. In both\ncases, the remote terminal would have to handle both originate and\nreceive error and block control procedures:\n\n     a. Through an addition to TIP software, the controlled\n     communication loop could terminate in the TIP, thus\n     providing error control only where it is most needed,\n     between the TIP and the terminal. This, however, would\n     involve additional TIP software and a block buffering\n     capability which may put an excessive load on the TIP.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\n     b. The other end of the block transmission error control\n     loop could be in the serving host system, either in an\n     applications program or in system support software.\n\n       If the remote end of the block transmission error control loop\nis in the serving host, then this software could possibly be used for\nhost-to-host, end-to-end error control in addition to\nhost-host-terminal end-to-end error control. For host-to-host\ncommunication, however, there would be a slight loss in efficiency due\nto the imbedded character-oriented format, unless an option were\nprovided in which start/stop bits were not required.\n\n\n-------------------------------\nNote 1: The most recent published data concerning data transmission\nerror performance of the switched telecommunications network is\nprovided in the 1969-70 Connection Survey conducted by Bell\nLaboratories. The results are published in The Bell System Technical\nJournal, Vol. 4, No. 50, April 1971.  In this survey, 12 receiving and\n92 transmitting sites in the U.S. and Canada were used with standard\nBell System Dataphone datasets used at both ends.  At both 1200 and\n2000 bps, approximately 82% of the calls had error rates of 1 error in\n10^5 bits or better, assuming an equal number of short, medium, and\nlong hauls.\n\n       The results of this survey for low-speed, start/stop data\ntransmission at rates up to 300 bps indicate a character error rate of\n1 error in 10^4 characters or better on 77.6% of all calls made within\nthe survey. It is interesting to note that only 48.3% of the low-speed\ndata tests completed were error-free. These tests were nominally 40\nminutes in length.\n\n       For voice grade private line data channels, the Bell System\ntechnical reference, \"Transmission Specifications for Voice Grade\nPrivate Line Data Channels,\" dated March 1969 reports \"When a Bell\nSystem dataset is combined with the recommended channel, the expected\nlong term average error rate of the system is 1 error in 10^5 bits or\nbetter during normal transmission conditions. \"\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 3]\n\f\n"
