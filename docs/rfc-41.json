The situation is not improved by the existence of sites that\nnow span all time zones of the U.S. and do not have direct voice\nconnection.\n\n\n        It is requested that everyone tag their IMP to IMP tele-\ntype messages that cause no response at the receiving IMP.\n\n\n        The transmitting IMP site should use 24 hour time and include\nthe time zone designation.\n\n\n   [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n   [ into the online RFC archives by Larry Campbell 7/97   ]\n\n\n\n"
