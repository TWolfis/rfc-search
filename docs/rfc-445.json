Whenever such\nrescheduling occurs, we will announce the fact as soon as possible via\ntwo mechanisms - the TIP NEWS and a Journal note (NOT an RFC) to\nTechnical Liaisons.  Any permanent changes to the schedule will be\nannounced via the RFC mechanism.\n\nAll times show below are Eastern Time.\n\n    First Monday (of each month)\n        BBN IMP [0830-1130]\n    First Tuesday\n        BBN TIP [0830-1130]\n        UCSB [1130-1430]\n    First Wednesday\n        CARNEGIE [0830-1130]\n        SRI [1130-1430]\n        XEROX [1500-1800]\n    First Thursday\n        SAAC [0830-1130]\n        UTAH [1030-1330]\n    Second Monday\n        MIT [0830-1130]\n        NOAA [1030-1330]\n    Second Tuesday\n        MITRE [0830-1130]\n        USC [1130-1430]\n    Second Wednesday\n        CCA [0830-1130]\n        STANFORD [1130-1430]\n        RADC [1430-1730]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKenzie                                                        [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 445         IMP/TIP Preventive Maintenance Schedule     January 1973\n\n\n    Second Thursday\n        BELVOIR [0830-1130]\n        UCSD [1130-1430]\n        PATRICK [0930-1230]\n    Third Monday\n        HARVARD [0830-1130]\n        UCLA [1000-1300]\n    Third Tuesday\n        RAND [1130-1430]\n        SDC [1530-1830]\n    Third Wednesday\n        ILLINOIS [0930-1230]\n        ARPA [0830-1130]\n        AMES IMP [1130-1430]\n    Third Thursday\n        ETAC [0830-1130]\n        FNWC [1130-1430]\n    Fourth Monday\n        CASE [0830-1130]\n        HAWAII [1330-1630]\n    Fourth Tuesday\n        NBS [0830-1130]\n        LBL [1130-1430]\n    Fourth Wednesday\n        LINCOLN [0830-1130]\n        AMES TIP [1130-1430]\n    Fourth Thursday\n        GWC [0930-1230]\n        ISI [1300-1600]\n        ABERDEEN [0830-1130]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by Alex McKenzie with    ]\n       [ support from GTE, formerly BBN Corp.             9/99 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcKenzie                                                        [Page 2]\n\f\n"
