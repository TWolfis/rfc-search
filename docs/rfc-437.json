Faeh\nRequest for Comments: 437              Computer Systems Laboratory, UCSB\nNIC: 13701                                                  30 June 1973\n\n\n                  DATA RECONFIGURATION SERVICE AT UCSB\n\n   This purpose of this RFC is to announce the availability of the Data\n   Reconfiguration Service (DRS) at UCSB, and to describe the use of the\n   DRS Time Sharing System.  The DRS is an experiment in a flexible\n   means for reformatting Network data streams.  The DRS provides a\n   means for coupling processes with different input/output interfaces,\n   and carrying out user specified transformations on the data passing\n   between them.  Samples of representative uses of the DRS include\n   field insertion, field deletion, variable length string processing,\n   string length computation, field transposition, character packing and\n   unpacking, and character set translations.\n\n   To use the DRS, a user first defines a \"form\", or a description of\n   the reformatting to be performed on data passing between two sockets\n   (a form is associated with each unidirectional message path).  DRS\n   may then be directed to establish Network connections with the two\n   processes involved and to monitor the dialogue between them.  DRS\n   receives an input stream from one process, reformats the input\n   according to the rules specified by the form, and emits the\n   reformatted data as an output stream to the second process.  The two\n   processes communicate as if they were directly connected to each\n   other.\n\n   Three major components comprise the DRS: a compiler which reduces DRS\n   source programs (forms) to a simpler, machine independent instruction\n   sequence (object program), an interpreter which executes the object\n   program created by the compiler, and an executive program, the DRS\n   Time Sharing System, which interfaces the Network user to the DRS.\n   Detailed descriptions of the DRS source language and compiler are\n   available in the following documents:\n\n      \"The Data Reconfiguration Service--An Experiment in Adaptable,\n      Process/Process Communications\", The Rand Corp., R-860-ARPA,\n      November 1971.\n\n      \"Data Reconfiguration Service Compiler: Communications Among\n      Heterogeneous Computer Centers Using Remote Resource Sharing\", The\n      Rand Corp.,R-887-ARPA, April 1972.\n\n   The DRS Time Sharing System (DRS/TSS) and its server Telnet are\n   currently available and addressable through socket 1281 decimal.\n   DRS/TSS interfaces the user to the DRS.  In addition to a subset of\n\n\n\nFaeh                                                            [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 437           DATA RECONFIGURATION SERVICE AT UCSB         June 1973\n\n\n   'TENEX-like' executive commands, commands are available for creating\n   and storing forms by name, and for invoking the DRS compiler or\n   interpreter.  Since both the compiler and the interpreter run\n   asynchronously to the DRS/TSS, the user is notified when execution of\n   his requests for compilations or interpreting are initiated and\n   terminated.  In addition, a diagnostic message is supplied by the\n   interpreter whenever it terminates execution of a form.\n\n   When a user connects to DRS/TSS he is allocated an internal TTY\n   number by which his terminal is identified.  When the user issues a\n   command to invoke the compiler or interpreter, his TTY number and a\n   user specified job name are used to uniquely identify the request.\n   The jobname is thereafter used to refer to the request.  A Network\n   host is specified by host name, or by host number preceded by #.  A\n   socket number is specified as an integer, optionally preceded by a\n   (decimal) to indicate the radix used.  Decimal is the default radix\n   and positive the default sign.  A negative socket number is\n   maintained in two's complement form.\n\n   The following control characters are recognized by DRS.  Control A\n   (SOH) or rubout (DEL) delete the last character, control V (SYN)\n   deletes the last word, control W (ETB) deletes the last phrase, and\n   control X (CAN) deletes the entire line.  Control D (EOT) displays\n   the current word, control E (ENQ) displays the current phrase, and\n   control F (ACK) displays the entire line.  Control Y (EM) displays\n   the name of the current phrase.  Command accept is carriage return-\n   line feed, or period.  A space will force recognition of the current\n   word, and '?' will list the input(s) currently possible.\n\n   The following sections describe the DRS/TSS command syntax. \u003cCA\u003e\n   denotes command accept, and brackets [] denote optional information.\n   All literal information is enclosed in quotes ''.

Control\n   C (ETX) signals the end of form definition and elicits the normal '$'\n   new line indicator.\n\n   Unfortunately, the current facilities for editing forms are extremely\n   limited.  Only the line currently being entered may be edited.  Once\n   a line has been terminated, with CR-LF, and the new line indicator\n   has appeared, the line may not be edited.  The following control\n   characters may be used to edit a form while it is being defined.\n   Control A (SOH) or Rubout (DEL) delete the last character, control X\n   (CAN) deletes the entire line, and control F (ACK) displays the\n   entire line.  If modifications need to be made to lines other than\n   the current line, the entire form must be deleted and reentered.\n\n   'DELETE' [\u003cfile type\u003e] \u003cformid\u003e \u003cCA\u003e\n\n   Deletes the specified component file(s) of form \u003cformid\u003e. \u003cfile type\u003e\n   specifies the component file to be deleted, either 'SOURCE',\n   'DIAGNOSTIC', or 'OBJECT_CODE'.

'SIMPLEX' implies that a\n   single unidirectional message path is to be employed, and requires\n   one set of \u003crun parameters\u003e. 'DUPLEX' implies that two message paths\n   will be employed are requires two sets of \u003crun parameters\u003e. \u003c run\n   parameters\u003e specify the data necessary to establish a Network\n   connection, time limits for the DRS interpreter, and the form which\n   is to be applied to the Network data stream.\n\n   \u003crun parameters\u003e = ('SICP' \u003csocket number\u003e|'UICP' [\u003chostid\u003e]\n                      \u003csocket number\u003e|'RFC'  [\u003chostid\u003e] \u003csocket\n                      number\u003e [\u003chostid\u003e] \u003csocket number\u003e)\n                      ['BYTE_SIZE' \u003cinteger\u003e] ['CONNECT_TIME'\n                      \u003cinteger\u003e] ['RUN_TIME' \u003cinteger\u003e] \u003cformid\u003e\n\n   Three methods are available for establishing Network connections:\n   'SICP', 'UICP', and 'RFC'.

In the case of 'SIMPLEX' runs, the\n   Network data flows between these two sockets, with the form being\n   applied to the data.  In the case of 'DUPLEX' runs, the connections\n   are somewhat more complex.  For 'DUPLEX' runs, two sets of \u003crun\n   parameters\u003e are specified, causing two socket pairs to be allocated,\n   and two forms to be specified.  Call these send socket 1, receive\n   socket 1, and form 1 (established via the first set of \u003crun\n   parameters\u003e and send socket 2, receive socket 2, and form 2\n   (established via the second set of parameters).  When interpreting\n   begins, data will flow from send socket 1, through form1, to receive\n   socket 2, and from send socket 2, through form 2, to receive socket\n   1. (Note that without this socket switching, processes would be\n   connected to themselves when 'SICP' or 'UICP' is specified.)\n\n   The user is notified when his requests for connections are initiated\n   and when the interpreter begins applying a form to a connection.\n   When execution of a form terminates, the user is supplied with a\n   diagnostic message provided by the interpreter as well as the actual\n   run time of the interpreter.\n\n   'SELECT' (\u003ctty list\u003e|\u003cCA\u003e) \u003cCA\u003e\n\n   Requests DRS to establish unidirectional links between the user's\n   terminal and the terminals specified in \u003ctty list\u003e.
