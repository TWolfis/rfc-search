I have in mind:\n\n      (a) accounting mechanisms\n\n      (b) documentation distribution\n\n      (c) person-to-person message sending and message storing\n\n      (d) access to systems by foreign users\n\nAttendees are invited to raise other topics.\n\nI envision that this meeting will spawn smaller subsidiary meetings\nduring the FJCC to pursue these or related topics.\n\nProspective attendees should notify my secretary Benita Kirstel (213)\n825-2368 so that we can be sure the room is large enough. Unexpected\nattendees are nevertheless invited.\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n          [ into the online RFC archives by Lloyd Duhon 4/97]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
