Harslem\nNIC: 7631                                             September 17, 1971\nUpdates: RFC 113\n\n\n                    DATA TRANSFER RATES (RAND/UCLA)\n\n   The attached memo indicates data rates typical of our use of RJS at\n   UCLA CCN.  Earlier timing tests (similar but more detailed) with UCSB\n   showed that most of the time was lost because of: (1) channel\n   contention with our disk drive access; (2) our NCP runs at a higher\n   priority than batch jobs but lower than text editing and interactive\n   graphics; (3) OS interrupt handling is very slow on both ends; (4)\n   spooling time of the remote system.\n\n\n\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\nTO:      John Heafner\nFROM:    Bob Hoffman\nCOPIES:  Bob Mobley, Herb Shukiar\n\nHere are some of the transmission rates I have noted over the network\nbetween Rand and UCLA.  These were all taken at night when little else\nwas happening on our 65.\n\nSEND TO UCLA\n\n   # Cards    Blocksize (bytes)  Time (secs)   Rate (bits/secs)\n      642        80                   50             8218\n      375        80                   30             8000\n      509       800                   20            16288\n\nRECEIVE FROM UCLA\n\n   For all figures below, the receiving file has blocksize of 1330\n   bytes, and each line is assumed to contain 100 bytes.  This last\n   assumption is fairly accurate, since most of the lines were from PL/I\n   for which this is a very good number.  Thus, for each rate, the\n   number of bytes is the # Lines * 100.\n\n   # Lines          Time (secs)      Rate (bits/secs)\n      4900              200             19600\n       872               47             14843\n      3900              185             16865\n\n\n\nHeafner \u0026 Harslem                                               [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 227             DATA TRANSFER RATES (RAND/UCLA)       September 1971\n\n\n   As you can see from the send figures, blocking makes about a 2:1\n   difference.  Memory also recalls a 2 or 3 to 1 advantage for blocking\n   on receive when we were getting unblocked files from UCSB.\n\n    REH:gb\n\n         [This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry]\n     [into the online RFC archives by Kelly Tardif, Viag\ufffdnie 10/99]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeafner \u0026 Harslem                                               [Page 2]\n\f\n"
