Watson\nRequest for Comments #196                  SRI-ARC\nNIC 7141                                   July 20, 1971\nCategories: A.5, D.7\nObsoletes: none\nUpdates: none\n\n                      A MAIL BOX PROTOCOL\n\nThe purpose of this protocol is to provide at each site a\nstandard mechanism to receive sequential files for immediate or\ndeferred printing or other uses.  The files for deferred printing\nwould probably be stored on intermediate disk files, although\ndetails of how a file is handled, stored, manipulated, or printed\nat a site are not the concern of this protocol.\n\nIt is also assumed that there would be a program at the sending\nsite which sends the file in the format given below with the\noptional control codes when appropriate.  This program could\nprobably be accessed as a subcommand of the Telnet program.\n\nThe motivation for developing this protocol is the Network\nInformation Center's (NIC) need to be able to deliver messages\nand documents to remote sites, and to be able to receive\ndocuments for cataloging, redistribution, and other purposes from\nremote site without having to know the details of path name\nconventions and file system commands at each site.  Multiple mail\nboxes (128) are allowed at each site and are identified as\ndescribed below.  The default is mail box number 0 for use with\nthe standard mail printer defined below.\n\nA mail box, as we see it, is simply a sequential file to which\nmessages and documents are appended, separated by an appropriate\nsite dependent code.\n\nAlthough this protocol will enable people to transmit messages\ndirectly without going through the NIC, we want to encourage\npeople to use the NIC as much as possible, so that dialogue will\nbe recorded, cataloged and available for viewing online at NIC,\nusing the powerful facilities of the ARC on Line System (NLS).\n\nThe Mail Box Protocol will use established network conventions,\nspecifically the Network Control Program, Initial Connection\nProtocol, and Data Transfer Protocol, NIC 7104.\n\nThe normal transmission is to be full 7-bit ASCII in 8-bit bytes,\nthe high order bit set to zero.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nA MAIL BOX PROTOCOL                             RFC 196  NIC 7141\n\nThe standard receiving mail printer for mail box number 0 is\nassumed to have a print line 72 characters wide, and a page of 66\nlines.  The new line convention will be carriage return (X'OD')\nfollowed by line feed (X'OA') as per the Telnet Protocol RFC 158,\nNIC 6768.  The standard printer will accept form feed (X'OC') as\nmeaning move paper to the top of a new page.\n\nIt is the senders responsibility to control the length of the\nprint line and page. If more than 72 characters per line are sent\nor if more than 66 lines are sent without a form feed, than the\nreceiving site can handle these situations as appropriate for\nthem.  These conventions can be changed by control codes as\ndescribed below.\n\nA message or document being sent to any mail box is a string of 8\nbit bytes.\n\nAt the head of the message or document sent to mail box number 0\nthere is to be an initial address string terminated by a form\nfeed.  This address string is to contain the sender's name and\naddress, and the receiver's name and address formatted in some\nreasonable, easy-to-read form for a clerk to read and distribute.\nComments could also be included in the address string.\n\nThe format of information in mail boxes other than mail box\nnumber 0 is not explicitly defined by this protocol.\n\nInitial Connection\n\n   Initial Connection will be as per the Official Initial\n   Connection Protocol, Documents #2, NIC 7101, to a standard\n   socket not yet assigned.  A candidate socket number would be\n   socket #5.\n\nData Transmission\n\n   Data Transmission will be as per the Data Transfer Protocol,\n   RFC 171, NIC 6793.  That is, there will be a Modes Available\n   handshake, and then transmission of special control\n   information and data. A message or document is defined to be a\n   block of data.  Control information is to be global.  That is,\n   once a control mode is set it is assumed to apply during the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\nA MAIL BOX PROTOCOL                             RFC 196  NIC 7141\n\n   life of the connection unless explicitly changed. More than\n   one document may be sent during the life of the connection\n   unless the infinite bit stream mode is used.  In the latter\n   case there will be one message or document per connection.  A\n   reasonable convention for control information sent using the\n   infinite bit stream mode seems to be to assume that is applies\n   only to the next data stream connection from the host which\n   sent the control stream.\n\nControl Information\n\n   The sending process should be capable of allowing the user to\n   indicate the control codes associated with the transmission of\n   a mail item.  The control codes can be used with any mail box\n   number.\n\n   Mail Box Number\n\n      A site may find, as is the case at NIC, that it is useful\n      to have more than one receiving mail box, each to be\n      associated with a different process.\n\n      The mail box number for material to be printed by the\n      standard mail printer is mail box number 0 and is used by\n      default.\n\n      Code X'DO'\n\n         Meaning: A seven bit binary number in an eight bit field\n         with the high order bit set to zero is to follow\n         indicating the receiving mail box number.\n\n   Transmission Code Type\n\n      The default code type is 7-bit ASCII in an 8 bit field,\n      high order bit to zero.\n\n      'Code X'AO'\n\n         Meaning: A Data Type signal indicating that the\n         transmission code is 7-bit ASCII in an 8-bit field, high\n         order set to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 3]\n\f\nA MAIL BOX PROTOCOL                             RFC 196  NIC 7141\n\n      Code X'A1'\n\n         Meaning: Transparency, i.e. a stream of 8 bit bytes.\n\n      Code X'A2'\n\n         Meaning:  EBCDIC\n\n      Other character codes could be added in the future.\n\n   Printer Control Codes\n\n      The default settings are a print line of 72 characters and\n      a print page of 66 lines.\n\n      Code X'D1\n\n         Meaning:  Set line width to 72 characters.\n\n      Code X'D2'\n\n         Meaning:  Use the full width of your printer.\n\n      Code X'D3'\n\n         Meaning:  Set page size to 66 lines.\n\n      Code X'D4'\n\n         Meaning:  Set page size to infinite.\n\n      Other virtual printer control codes can be added in the\n      future.\n\n      Other classes of control codes can be added as the need\n      arises.\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 4]\n\f\n"
