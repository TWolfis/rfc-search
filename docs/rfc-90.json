INTRODUCTION\n\n   CCN, the Campus Computing network of UCLA, will shortly be connected\n   to the ARPA Network as a host of the \"Service Center\" type. The\n   purpose of this RFC is to describe the hardware and software available\n   at CCN and the services we are now planning to provide to other\n   Network Hosts.\n\n   These services and their implementation priority were chosen in\n   consultation with a particular site (RAND) which plans to use CCN via\n   the Network. We would welcome requests and comments from other sites.\n\nB. CCN HARDWARE\n\n   CCN operates an IBM 360/91KK, i.e., a Model 91 CPU with a 4 million\n   byte fast memory.\n\n      CPU Speed:      Highly program-dependent; 2-6 Mips, with 3 Mips as a\n                      useful average.  The upper end of this range occurs\n                      heavy floating point in the inner loops.  The decimal\n                      arithmetic operation of a 360 should be avoided as\n                      they are executed interpretively by the 91.\n\n      Memory Speed:   Memory is interleaved 16 ways and extensively\n                      buffered. Effective memory fetch time is 600 ns in\n                      lower 2 million bytes, 900 ns in upper 2 million\n                      bytes.\n\n      I/O Con-\n      figuration      a) 6 2860       Selector Channels\n                      b) 1 2870       Multiplexor Channcl (with 16 control\n                                      unit RPQ)\n                      c) 5 2314       Disk Storage Units (i.e., 40 disk\n                                      drives).\n                      d) 1 2301       Drum (Systems residence and catalog\n                                      only.)\n                      e) 5 (245x)     9 track tape drives (80O bpi)\n                      f) 3 (240x)     7 tracts tape drives (200/556/800 bpi)\n                      g) 1  2291      (Modified 2250 CRT) Operator/\n                                      Maintenance Console.\n\n\n\n\nBraden                                                          [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 90              CCN As a Network Service Center         January 1971\n\n\n                      Also on the Multiplexor Channel are:\n\n                      h) 2 card readers and 4 high speed printers at CCN;\n\n                      i) Four 40,000 baud interfaces for CCI alphanumeric\n                         TV display consoles (currently supporting 40\n                         consoles);\n\n                      j) Six data communication ports (3 dial @ 2000 baud,\n                         1 dedicated @ 4800 baud, and 2 dedicated @ 50,000\n                         baud) for remote batch entry terminals;\n\n                      k) a Calcomp plotter;\n\n                      l) an interface for BBS Teleputers (the Culler-Fried\n                         system);\n\n                      m) Ten dial ports for 2741 typewriter terminals;\n                         and finally:\n\n                      n) the IMP Interface\n\nC. OPERATING SYSTEM\n\n   The Model 91 operates under the IBM-supplied MVT version of OS/360,\n   currently Release 18.6. This system contains a set of modifications\n   developed at CCN for control of batch job flow. MVT is a realization\n   of the general process model of multiprogramming, although this fact\n   is obscured by IBM's terminology. For example, a process is called a\n   task in MVT, while the fork primitive is called \"ATTACH\".\n\nD. USER SOFTWARE\n\n   1. Processors:\n\n       CCN provides the following user software:\n\n       a) The usual FORTRAN compilers (FORT G. FORT H. WATFOR);\n\n       b) PL/1 (version 5) and PL/C (Cornell's student PL/1);\n\n       c) Assembler G;\n\n       d) IBM Algol F;\n\n       e) IBM Linkage Editor F, and a fast in-core linkage editor written\n          at CCN;\n\n\n\n\nBraden                                                          [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 90              CCN As a Network Service Center         January 1971\n\n\n       f) Miscellaneous processors, including:\n\n          COBOL, SPI, XP7, META-5, SNOBOL, LISP 1.5, AUTOFLOW  SIMSCRIPT\n          1.5, MIX (Knuth's student machine), CSMP, GPSS, ECAP, APT, PMS,\n          MATLAN, SYMAP, SPSS, and the BMD series}\n\n       g) the IBM file utilities, SORT, and RPG.\n\n   2. Interactive Systems\n\n       a) URSA        Conversational remote job entry system based\n                      on alphanumeric display consoles (IBM 2260\n                      and CCI CC301 consoles). URSA provides a\n                      number of other services, including a \"desk\n                      calculator\", an interactive/interpretive\n                      assembler, and on-line utilities for manipu-\n                      lation of the OS file system. It also con\n                      tains the CCN operator interface to MVT.\n                      URSA is not suitable for typewriter interaction\n                      because it is designed for \"instantaneous\" dis\n                      play of at least 480 characters at a time.\n\n       b) APL         IBM Program Product version of this well-known\n                      interactive system. Currently supports IBM 2741's\n                      (Selectric typewriter terminals) only.\n\n       c) OLMS        UCLA implementation of the Culler-Fried system;\n                      nearly identical in language to the UCSX On-line\n                      System.\n\n      d) TSO          IBM's new general purpose time-sharing subsystem\n                      under MVT, to be available at CCS sometime during\n                      1971. TSO supports 2741's and Teletypes (and at\n                      CCN it will support CCI consoles). TSO is\n                      reminiscent of CTSS in its capabilities and\n                      command language.\n\n\nE. REMOTE JOB SERVICE\n\n       The RJS (\"remote Job service\") subsystem, was written by CCN to\n   support remote batch terminals communicating over dial and leased\n   lines. A remote batch terminal consists of a set of unit record\n   devices (one or more card readers, printers, and punches) driven\n   either by a hardwired controller or by a small CPU (e.g., IBM Model 20\n   or 1130). A remote RJS user enters OS/360 jobs, complete with JCL,\n   into the remote reader; the jobs are spooled into the operating system\n   and run in their turn, and the printed and/or punched output is\n\n\n\nBraden                                                          [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC 90              CCN As a Network Service Center         January 1971\n\n\n   returned to the remote terminal from which the jobs originated (unless\n   the user or operator re-routes the output). The remote terminal may\n   also include a console typewriter to be used by the remote operator to\n   receive and send messages and to exert control over his terminal.\n\nF. FAST BATCH SUBSYSTEM\n\n       CCN has written a fast batch subsystem called QUICKRUN to provide\n   \"instant\" turnaround for small, simple batch jobs which are common in\n   a university computing center. QUICKRUN accepts a very simple job\n   control language (\"QCL\") without much of the generality of OS/360 JCL.\n\n       QUICKRUN is really a batch job control subsystem which itself runs\n   essentially as a job within MVT. Because of its lack of generality,\n   the QUICKRUN subsystem creates much less system overhead than normal\n   OS batch; this is reflected in lower cost per job in QUICKRUN.\n\n       QUICKRUN is available at remote batch terminals through RJS as\n   well as through a self-service card reader at CCN.\n\nG. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n   1. Core Memory for Batch Jobs\n\n      CCN can easily run batch jobs requiring up to 3 million bytes,\n      although jobs over 600K bytes will normally not run during prime\n      time.\n\n   2. Disk Space\n\n      CCN provides extensive on-line disk space for permanent files. The\n      resident disk pack configuration includes:\n\n      220 M bytes (8 packs) of user source programs, for use through\n      URSA.\n\n      170 M bytes (6 packs) of user object and load modules (\"binary\n      decks\") and other files.\n\n      100 M bytes of limited-time storage (n days, where n is published\n      number satisfying 7\u003c= n \u003c 0)\n\n      This space is charged for, at about 5s per kilobyte per month.\n\n      In the future, we plan to significantly extend this on-line space\n      by implementing a tertiary storage system using magnetic tapes.\n      In addition, a batch job may always request that the user's own\n      disk pack be mounted, thus allowing very large private collections\n\n\n\nBraden                                                          [Page 4]\n\f\nRFC 90              CCN As a Network Service Center         January 1971\n\n\n      of files.\n\n   3. Rates\n\n      Batch charges are based upon t(CPU time), I(number of I/O requests\n      ), and R(core memory region size). The current rate schedule may be\n      obtained from:\n\n           Mr. Kenneth Tom\n           User Relations Supervisor\n           UCLA\n           Campus Computing Network\n           Math Sciences Addition\n           Los Angeles, California 90024\n\n      Generally speaking, the CCN Model 91 cost is very attractive for\n      compute-bound, heavy floating-point calculations, particularly\n      where large regions are required. For most other jobs, the CCN\n      machine is competitive with other cost-recovery computing centers\n      which operate without special subsidy.\n\nG. SERVICE TO NETWORK\n\n           CCN currently plans to provide RJS, URSA, and (eventually)\n      TSO service to the Network. Each of these will have its own third-\n      level protocol. In addition, there will be a \"transparent\" third\n      level protocol to allow a user-written program running in batch or\n      TSO at CCN to converse directly with the Network.\n\n           The third-level protocols, in the order in which we plan to\n      implement them, are as follows:\n\n           1. NETRJS\n\n              NETRJS is the name of the third level protocol by which a\n              user process in a remote host will simulate a remote batch\n              terminal connected to CCN's RJS system. Thus, NETRJS will\n              allow a user to submit complete batch jobs to the 360/91\n              and receive their print and punch output streams back over\n              the Network. NETRJS has been specified in RFC #88 and\n              implementation is targeted for March, 1971.\n\n           2. NETCRT\n\n              This protocol will allow a Network user to simulate an\n              (idealized) CCI alphanumeric display console and use CCN's\n              URSA system (and eventually TS0). An initial version of\n              NETCRT will be circulated shortly as an RFC.\n\n\n\nBraden                                                          [Page 5]\n\f\nRFC 90              CCN As a Network Service Center         January 1971\n\n\n           3. NETTRANS\n\n              This is the \"transparent\" protocol allowing a user process\n              at CCN to talk over the Network. It has not yet been\n              specified.\n\n           4. NETTYPE\n\n              This protocol will allow a real or simulated 2741 to use\n              TS0 (and perhaps APL) via the Network.\n\nH.
