No testing was done on July 11 and 12 as I was on\n   vacation.\n\n   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing as they\n   are presently intended to be users only.  Included here are the\n   Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE, RADC,\n   NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, NOAA, SAAC, ARPA, and BBN*).  This category also\n   includes the Network Control Center computer (Network address 5)\n   which is used solely for gathering statistics from the Network.\n   Finally, included among these Hosts are the following:\n\n   Network\n   Address           Site            Computer\n   -------           ----            --------\n   7                 Rand            IBM-360/65\n   73                Harvard         PDP-1\n   138               Lincoln         TSP\n   12                Illinois        PDP-11\n   19                NBS             PDP-11\n   23                USC             IBM-360/44\n\n   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this\n   period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   ---------\n   *The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as such\n   is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to refine\n   and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n\nWestheimer                                                      [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 367                   NETWORK HOST STATUS                  July 1972\n\n\n   NO.
