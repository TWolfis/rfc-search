The NCC telephone and operators\n   will be available as usual during this period.  We hope to have\n   the IMP back on the Network by early Saturday afternoon; the\n   choice of Saturday morning was made intentionally so that if by\n   some stroke of fate all our wideband lines stay down longer than\n   anticipated, the impact on others in the network will be minimized.\n   We anticipate that all other sites will operate normally through\n   this period.\n\n   Shortly subsequent to this move, a new Host will be connected to\n   the net.  This is a PDP-1D at BBN which will be used for certain\n   additional NCC functions.  It will not be a Server site.  We\n   prefer the Host name \"BBN-1D\"; its network address will be 197.\n\n\n   RA/jm\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
