Any user may be asked to log off on\n   short notice.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\n   As soon as the user's Telnet connection is established to the NIC,\n   the system herald will be printed, followed immediately by a brief\n   (possibly null) message to network users.  This message will contain\n   any items that are of particular interest to network users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n   In order to log in:\n\n      use your site ident as the user name\n\n      the password is ARPA\n\n      use an account number consisting of site ident-your last name\n\n         for example, if we receive the string\n                log ucla-nmc arpa ucla-postel\n         the user will be logged in as John Postel from UCLA\n\n   After logging in, the (possibly null) system message common to all\n   logins will be printed.\n\n   If you experience any trouble getting into the NIC, call us via the\n   telephone numbers listed below.  If the number is not listed as a\n   direct dial, you must contact your operator and ask for the appro-\n   priate Zenith or Enterprise number.  If the operator is unfamiliar\n   with the use of Enterprise or Zenith numbers, ask to speak to the\n   supervisor.\n\n      Dick Watson for administrative problems.\n\n      John Melvin vor NCP or Telnet problems.\n\n      Marily Auerbach or Dirk van Nouhuys for TNLS problems.\n\n      If NIC personnel do not answer, a local answering service will\n      take the call.  Give the name of the person to whom your question\n      is directed and your question or comment.  We will contact the\n      answering service every morning and reply as soon as possible.\n\n         Ident        Site                         Phone\n\n         AMES-CD      NASA Ames                    dial direct, 329-0740\n                      CD Group\n\n         AMES-ILLIAC  NASA Ames                    dial direct, 329-0740\n                      ILLIAC Group\n\n         ARPA         Advanced Research            Enterprise 1-0740\n                      Projects Agency\n\n         BBN-NET      BBN                          Enterprise 0740\n                      Network Group\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\n         BBN-TENEX    BBN                          Enterprise 0740\n                      TENEX Group\n\n         CASE         Case Western Reserve         Enterprise 0740\n                      University\n\n         CMU          Carnegie-Mellon              Enterprise 9074\n                      University\n\n         HARV         Harvard University           Enterprise 0740\n\n         ILL          University of Illinois       Enterprise 1074\n\n         LINC-67      M.I.T.
