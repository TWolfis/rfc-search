The Technical Liaison contact at each HOST site is asked\nto review these questions and fill in the answers as soon as convenient\nafter receipt.\n\n\n        One of the members of the committee listed below will contact\neach HOST site by telephone in the next few days to record the answers.\n\n   Committee members include:\n\n         Bob Long                   SDC\n\n         John Melvin                SRI/ARC\n\n         Ed Meyer                   MIT/MAC\n\n         Tom O'Sullivan             RDS\n\n\n        Results of the questionnaire will be tabulated and distributed\nas an RFC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n                      NETWORK HOST QUESTIONNAIRE*\n\n                        For TELNET Consideration\n\nInstallation __________________________  Prepared By _______________\n\nSystem**  _____________________________  Date  _____________________\n\n1.)
