Basically, each organization represented is\n\nexpected to participate by presenting one or more working papers in\n\none or more of the areas chosen for discussion.  A minimal working\n\npaper is defined to consist of a set of written notes and an oral\n\npresentation.  We suggest that the RFC mechanism be used to\n\ndisseminate the written working notes.  I am asking that all attendees\n\nmake reservations no later than June 1st and that all RFC's and\n\nworking notes which are pertinent to this meeting be in my hand no\n\nlater than Tuesday, June 22nd.  We will publish by June 25th a\n\nbibliography of reading material pertinent to this graphic meeting and\n\na list of prospective attendees.  Authors of working notes not\n\ndisseminated through the RFC mechanism are responsible for mailing to\n\neach attendee a copy of his working notes no later than July 1, 1971.\n\n\n     Each attendee making a presentation can expect a telephone call\n\nfrom me about July 5 to find how much time he wants for his\n\npresentation.  The times will be scaled appropriately to fit the\n\nschedule.\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n        [ into the online RFC archives by Stephane Alnet 4/97 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVezza                                                           [Page 2]\n\f\n"
