John Melvin will have it fixed by\n             the time you read this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n                                                            RFC 193\n\n\n   LL-67:    Joel Winett telles me NCP, ICP, EBCDIC, Telnet and\n             access to a virtual 360 are working.  Due to hard-\n             ware difficulties we have not verified this.\n   BBN-10:   Same difference as SRI with respect to Telnet.\n             Under certain conditions, the ICP generates a\n             zero byte size.  Ray Tomlinson tells me these\n             idiosyncracies will be taken care of in about\n             a week.  Three sites have commented that TENEX\n             assigns the same local socket to multiple connec-\n             tions, when acting as a server.  Ray says that\n             this is the design -- not an error.  BBN TENEX\n             is currently being used productively via the\n             Net, for some non-Network related problems.\n   UTAH:     Our tests with UTAH were pre-TENEX.  TENEX is\n             currently being installed at UTAH.\n   MIT-645:  Our understanding is that most software is\n             working; we have not verified this.\n\n\n\n         [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n          [ into the online RFC archives by Paul Williams 6/97 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\n"
