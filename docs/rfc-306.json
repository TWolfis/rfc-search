These\n   Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n      1)  Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network\n          as servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular\n          basis for at least two weeks.  Included here are:\n\n          NETWORK              SITE                COMPUTER\n          ADDRESS\n\n          133                  BBN                 PDP-10  (B)\n          13                   Case                PDP-10\n          15                   Ames/(Paoli)        ILLIAC/(B6500)\n\n      2)  Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included\n          here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network\n          (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN*).  This category also includes the\n          Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is\n          used solely for gathering statistics from the Network.\n          Finally, included among these Hosts are the following:\n\n          NETWORK              SITE                COMPUTER\n          ADDRESS\n\n          7                    Rand                IBM-360/65\n          73                   Harvard             PDP-1\n          12                   Illinois            PDP-11\n          19                   NBS                 PDP-11\n\n   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this\n   period.\n\n   ________\n   *The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\n   such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to\n   refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n\nWestheimer                                                      [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 306                   Network Host Status              February 1972\n\n\n                                                           \"STATUS OR\n   SITE     SITE         COMPUTER      STATUS OR           PREDICTIONS\"\n   ADDRESS                             PREDICTION          OBTAINED FROM\n\n      1     UCLA         SIGMA-7       Server # Limited   Jon Postel\n     65     UCLA         IBM-360/91    NETRJS now         Bob Braden\n                                       (Telnet in April)\n      2     SRI(NIC)     PDP-10        Server             John Melvin\n     66     SRI(AI)      PDP-10        SOON               Len Chaiten\n      3     UCSB         IBM-360/75    Server             Jim White\n      4     UTAH         PDP-10        Server             Barry Wessler\n     *5     BBN(NCC)     DDP-516       Never              Alex McKenzie\n     69     BBN(TENEX-A) PDP-10        Server             Dan Murphy\n   *133     BBN(TENEX-B) PDP-10        Server(Exper.)
