No testing was done on May 15 due to the attempt\n   to install the new IMP system on that day.\n\n   During this interval the PDP-10 of the MIT Artificial\n   Intelligence Group (Network address 134) and the PDP-10 at\n   Stanford (Network address 11) each became Network Servers.\n\n   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.\n   These Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n        1)  Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the\n            Network as servers (available for use from other sites)\n            on a regular basis for at least two weeks.  The only\n            Host in this category is the PDP-10 at Case (Network\n            address 13).\n\n        2)  Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.\n            Included here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently\n            in the Network (AMES, MITRE, NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, and\n            BBN*).  This category also includes the Network Control\n            Center computer (Network address 5) which is used solely\n            for gathering statistics from the Network.  Finally,\n            included among these Hosts are the following:\n\n            Network\n            Address              Site                   Computer\n            -------              ----                   --------\n               7                Rand                    IBM-360/65\n              73                Harvard                 PDP-1\n              12                Illinois                PDP-11\n              19                NBS                     PDP-11\n              23                USC                     IBM-360/44\n\n   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status\n   for this period.\n   _____________\n   *The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\n   such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used\n   to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n\"STATUS OR\n SITE                                                     PREDICTIONS\nADDRESS  SITE         COMPUTER    STATUS OR PREDICTION  OBTAINED FROM\n-------  ----         --------    -------------------   -------------\n   1     UCLA         SIGMA-7     Server #Limited       Jon Postel\n  65     UCLA         IBM-360/91  NETRJS now            Bob Braden\n                                  (Telnet in June)\n   2     SRI(NIC)     PDP-10      Server                Jim White\n  66     SRI(AI)      PDP-10      Server                Len Chaiten\n   3     UCSB         IBM-360/75  Server                Ron Stoughton\n   4     UTAH         PDP-10      Server                Barry Wessler\n  *5     BBN(NCC)     DDP-516     Never                 Alex McKenzie\n  69     BBN(TENEX-A) PDP-10      Server                Dan Murphy\n 133     BBN(TENEX-B) PDP-10      Server(Exper.)
