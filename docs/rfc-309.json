People have expressed an\n   interest in revising the existing ARPANET Data and File Transfer\n   Protocols (RFC # 264 and RFC # 265), to make them more suitable\n   to fulfill the now better understood ARPANET requirements.\n\n        The objective of this workshop is to arrive at a unified\n   convention for ARPANET data and file transfer.  It is important\n   that we adequately consider the needs of TIP users, DATACOMPUTER\n   users, remote job entry users, and the major ARPANET service\n   systems.\n\n        In addition to the current members of the data and file\n   transfer protocol committee, I have invited a number of\n   interested parties to talk and participate in this workshop.  On\n   the first day's agenda is a list of speakers who have agreed to\n   discuss their respective interests in data and file transfer.  If\n   your interests have not been represented and you would like to\n   give a presentation or discuss a specific area, please contact me\n   (617-864-6900 Ext. 1428).\n\n        Participants are encouraged to have written position papers\n   ready at the time of this meeting.  If possible, these papers\n   should be distributed as NWG/RFCs or informal notes to workshop\n   invitees, prior to the workshop.\n\n        As this meeting is intended to be an intensive workshop,\n   with the second half devoted to a detailed specification of\n   protocol, it will be necessary to limit attendance.  The\n   attendance to this meeting is by invitation only.  A list of\n   invitees is attached.  If you have not been invited, and would\n   like to attend the workshop, please contact me.\n\n        Hotel reservations may be made at Random House, operated by\n   MIT's Real Estate office ($5.00 to $7.00/night), by contacting\n   either me or Sue Pitkin (617-864-6900 Ext. 1450)  before March\n   31st.  If you would prefer other hotel accomodations instead, a\n   convenient hotel is the Fenway motor Hotel (Tel. 617-492-4777).\n\n        Please contact either me or Sue Pitkin if you intend to come.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nNWG/RFC # 309                                              Abhay Bhushan\n\n\n                                 AGENDA\n                                 ------\n\n   FRIDAY April 14th, 1972\n   -----------------------\n\n        8th Floor Conference Room, MIT Project MAC,\n        545 Technology Square, Cambridge, Mass.\n\n                      Morning Session -- 9:00 a.m.\n                      ----------------------------\n\n   LIST OF SPEAKERS\n\n        Steve Crocker -- ARPA\n             Keynote Address and General Discussion\n\n        Richard Winter -- CCA\n             The DATACOMPUTER and ARPANET Protocols\n\n        William Crowther -- BBN-NET\n             Data and File Transfer to Terminal IMPs\n\n        Robert T.
