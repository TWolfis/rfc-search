Function\n\n   This document describes a program whose function is to make an Online\n   System terminal _appear_ to any teletype-compatible, time-sharing\n   system in the Network _as if it were directly connected to that\n   system_.  By invoking this program from his terminal, an OLS user can\n   effectively dial up a system at another site and use it as if he were\n   a local user of that system.  The program performs the following\n   major functions:\n\n      1) it resolves keyboard and display device incompatibilities\n\n      2) performs character set transformations, and\n\n\n\n\nWhite                                                           [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 206                      A User TELNET                   August 1971\n\n\n      3) makes its presence and that of the Network transparent to the\n         user.\n\n   The program which performs these functions is called a _User TELNET_.\n   It operates in conjunction with another program called a _Server\n   TELNET_ executing at the site whose system is being used.  A Server\n   TELNET exists at each site whose system is accessible from the Net.\n   Similarly, a User TELNET must exist at a site before users at that\n   site have access to remote systems.\n\n   User and Server TELNETs access the Net through their respective NCPs,\n   and operate under a Network-standard protocol which specifies the\n   hand-shaking procedure by which the two parties connect themselves to\n   one another, as well as the format of data sent over a pair of\n   Network connections established between them.  A User TELNET makes\n   such protocol considerations transparent to its users.\n\n   The TELNET protocol is based upon the notion of a virtual teletype,\n   employing a 7-bit ASCII character set.  The primary function of a\n   User TELNET, then, is to provide the means by which its users can\n   'hit' all the keys on that virtual teletype.  If the user's keyboard\n   happens in fact to actually be a teletype, then the mapping procedure\n   is a very simple one.  However, in UCSB's case, where a user's input\n   device is an OLS keyboard (a device very different from a teletype),\n   the mapping is more complex.\n\n   The primary function of a Server TELNET is to map the keys on the\n   virtual teletype into that set of keys _its_ local users can push on\n   _their_ keyboards.  Again, if those keyboards are teletypes, the\n   mapping done by the Server TELNET is straightforward.  In other\n   cases, the task may be very complex.\n\n   A similar set of mappings transforms ouput generated by the remote\n   system into a form displayable on the user's output device (in UCSB's\n   case, this device is normally a storage scope).\n\nII.  Invoking TELNET\n\n   This and succeeding sections describe a preliminary version of a User\n   TELNET (hereafter referred to simply as TELNET) currently implemented\n   within the Online System.  This initial implementation does not\n   provide all of the services that a final version must provide, nor\n   does it provide all the conveniences that the next version will\n   offer.  It's a first pass which will be upgraded in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite                                                           [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 206                      A User TELNET                   August 1971\n\n\n   TELNET is accessible from NET, a subsystem (like MOLSF and COL) of\n   OLS.  A user is by default prohibited from loading NET.  To have\n   access to NET enabled fro his user number, a user need only contact\n   the Computer Center.  Assuming the foregoing, Net can be loaded with\n   the key sequence:\n\n      KEYBOARD ENTRY          OLS QUERY/RESPONSE\n      SYST                    WORK AREAS UPDATED\n      LOAD NET                LOAD NET\n      RETURN                  FILE LOADED\n\n   or by specifying the system name 'NET' at login.\n\n   Once in NET, TELNET is invoked by going to Level II Real and hitting\n   _LOG_.  TELNET responds with a query for site number.  The user\n   should enter in decimal the number of the site (as indicated in\n   Figure 1) to which he desires access, followed by _RETURN_.  TELNET\n   will then query the user for the Server TELNET's socket_number.  By\n   convention, this number is normally 1, but in certain cases some\n   other socket may be appropriate.  In any case, the user should enter\n   the socket number in decimal and hit _RETURN_.  The dialogue, then,\n   goes like this:\n\n      KEYBOARD ENTRY          OLS QUERY/RESPONSE\n      II LOG                  FOREIGN SITE NO. = (site number)\n      site number RETURN      FOREIGN SCK NO. = 1\n      1 RETURN\n\n   When the second RETURN is depressed, TELNET will attempt to contact\n   the designated Server TELNET and establish a duplex connection for\n   the user.  Once the connection has been established, TELNET will\n   erase the tube and position the carriage to the upper left-hand\n   corner of the screen.  From this point on, the user is effectively\n   connected to the remote system.  TELNET enters a mode in which keys\n   pushed by the user are mapped into their virtual-teletype equivalents\n   and incoming text similarly transformed and displayed on the scope.\n   If the remote system to which the user is connected normally issues a\n   login message, that message will be the first to be displayed.  In\n   any case, the user should proceed by logging in to the remote system\n   according to the conventions appropriate to that system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite                                                           [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC 206                      A User TELNET                   August 1971\n\n\n                                 Figure 1.\n\n                               Network Sites\n\nInstitution     Location        Computer        Site    Site #  Site #\n                                                Name    (HEX)   (DEC)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUCLA            Los Angeles     Sigma-7         UCLA    01        1\n\nUCLA            Los Angeles     IBM 360/91      UCL1    41       65\n\nStanford Research\nInstitute       Menlo Park      PDP-10          SRI0    02        2\n\nStanford Research\nInstitute       Menlo Park      PDP-15          SRI1    42       66\n\nUCSB            Santa Barbara   IBM 360/75      UCSB    03        3\n\nUniversity of   Salt Lake City,\nUtah            Utah            PDP-10          UTAH    04        4\n\nBolt, Beranek,  Cambridge,\nand Newman      Mass.

The Virtual Teletype\n\n   The algorithm by which TELNET maps the OLS keyboard into the virtual\n   teletype's character set, and by which it maps that same character\n   set into the set of characters which can be displayed on the user's\n   storage scope is defined in Figure 2.  A line of that figure reads as\n   follows:\n\n      For line 11:\n\n      The key labeled 'LF' (meaning 'Line Feed') on the virtual\n      teletype, sometimes referred to as 'control-J', is struck by\n      pressing either _SUB_, _CASE J_, or [1] on an OLS keyboard.\n      TELNET sends to the remote system an 8-bit character with the\n      value X'0A'.  Whenever 'LF' is received from the foreign system,\n      TELNET displays it by rolling the carriage down one line.\n\n   As indicated in the figure, _CASE_ substitutes for the CNTRL key on a\n   teletype.  Hence, for example, 'control-C' is represented by the key\n   pair 'CASE C'.  Note, however, that _CASE_ and 'C' are hit in\n   sequence, whereas on a teletype the CNTRL key is held down while 'C'\n   is struck.  'CASE A' - 'CASE Z' each have an equivalent on the upper\n   keyboard, and the position of that key on the upper keyboard\n   corresponds to that of its counterpart on the lower keyboard.  Hence,\n   LS equivalent to CASE A.\n\n\n\n\nWhite                                                           [Page 5]\n\f\nRFC 206                      A User TELNET                   August 1971\n\n\n   Although TELNET provides the user with the means for transmitting\n   both upper- and lower-case alphabetics (hitting 'A' sends a lower-\n   case 'A'; holding down _SHIFT_ and hitting 'A' sends upper-case 'A'),\n   there is no provision in OLS for displaying lower-case characters on\n   the storage scope.  Hence, TELNET maps lower-case alphabetics into\n   upper-case before displaying them.\n\n   The four virtual teltype keys 'ENQ', 'ACK', 'BEL', and 'NAK' are\n   displayed by TELNET in a special manner.  Two lines are reserved for\n   these characters at the top of the display area, and whenever TELNET\n   receives such a character from the remote system, it displays it in\n   its assigned position within the two-line field.  TELNET always\n   positions those four characters at the top of the display area,\n   regardless of the user's current position on the scope, then returns\n   to it.\n\n   A storage scope has both positive and negative attributes relative to\n   a teletype.  Display is much quieter on a scope than on a teletype.\n   However, the noise made by the return of a teletype carriage is often\n   a valuable cue to the user, frequently signifying that the previous\n   line of input from the user has been accepted by the system.  As a\n   substitute for this particular cue, TELNET displays an underline\n   ('_') at the left edge on the next line whenever it receives a\n   carriage return (CR) from the remote system.\n\n                Figure 2.

In particular, when a system displays a whole series of\n   lines of text without requiring input from the user, the display may\n   be wrapped around from the bottom of the scope to the top, and begin\n   overlaying itself before the user has had some time to read it all.\n   In such cases, the following strategy is sometimes useful (and will\n   make sense once the next section -- Section IV -- has been read): hit\n   _II_ before the display begins to wrap around upon itself; the\n   display will stop.  After the text has been read, erase the scope and\n   hit _LOG_ and display will resume.\n\n   If the user hits _ERASE_ while in TELNET, that key will have its\n   usual effect; it will have _no_effect upon the remote system.\n   However, because of a quirk in the current implementation of TELNET,\n   _ERASE_ will have the one additional effect of causing the display of\n   incoming text to be suspended until another key on the virtual\n   teletype is struck.  The user is thus cautioned against erasing the\n   scope while waiting for a response from the remote system.  However,\n   the user can extricate himself from the situation described by\n   following the _ERASE_ with NUL on the virtual teletype.\n\nIV.  Returning to TELNET\n\n   The user can at any time escape from TELNET (and hence from the\n   remote system to which he is attached) by depressing a level key\n   (e.g., I, II,...,_SYST, TYPE, LIST_) or of course, by hitting\n   _RESET_.  Any time thereafter, the user may return to TELNET by\n   hitting _II LOG_ (on NET) once again, and resume operation on his\n   remote system _exactly where he left off_.  When _'II LOG'_ is\n   pressed this second time, instead of querying the user for site\n   number as before, TELNET will notice that the user is already\n   connected to a remote system and simply resume where _it_ left off.\n\n   After he escapes from TELNET and before he returns to it, the user\n   may engage himself in any other Online System activity short of\n   logging out but including changing systems, while still retaining the\n   option of subsequently returning to TELNET and resuming activity on\n   the remote system to which he remains connected.  The user can\n   exploit this property of TELNET to obtain hard copy of a selected\n   portion of his dialogue with the remote system.  The user simply\n   brings his system to the point at which a listing is thereby desired,\n   escapes from TELNET by hitting _'TYPE SEL' 1,4 RETURN'_, thereby\n\n\n\nWhite                                                          [Page 11]\n\f\nRFC 206                      A User TELNET                   August 1971\n\n\n   selecting the line printer as a secondary output device, and then\n   returns to TELNET by pressing _'II LOG'_.  All subsequent\n   communication with the remote system will be recorded for eventual\n   output on the printer.  Logging off of OLS while escaped from TELNET\n   causes the TELNET connection to be broken automatically by the\n   system.\n\nV. Breaking TELNET Connections\n\n   At any time while the user is in contact with TELNET, after the\n   connection to the remote system has been established, the user may\n   terminate that connection by hitting _'CON RETURN'_.  TELNET will\n   respond _'SOCKETS PURGED_'.  \\ subsequent call to TELNET (i.e., a\n   subsequent instance of _'II LOG'_) will illicit the original query\n   for remote site number.  The user is then free to connect himself to\n   another foreign system.\n\n   The user is cautioned that breaking Network connections as just\n   described is not necessarily equivalent to logging out of the remote\n   system.  Some Server TELNETs may, when they detect the breaking of\n   connections, log the user off of their system; others may leave the\n   user logged on.  The user should be aware of the conventions of the\n   systems he uses and, where appropriate, log himself off before\n   breaking connections.\n\n   The key sequence _'I DEL RETURN'_ will also terminate a TELNET\n   connection, but all other connections that may have been previously\n   established using the operators of Level I are closed as well.\n\nVI. Abnormal Network Conditions\n\n   While the user is in TELNET and attached to a remote system, TELNET\n   monitors the user's Network connections.  If any abnormal condition\n   is detected, it terminates its monitoring and issues a message of the\n   form:\n\n            {CONNECT}\n            {INPUT}         ERROR - CODE = n\n            {OUTPUT}\n\n   where 'n' is one of the values listed in Figures 3-5.  A CONNECT\n   error may occur during TELNET's initial attempt to establish\n   connections to the remote system; an INPUT error may occur when\n   TELNET attempts to extract incoming data from the NET; and an OUTPUT\n   error may occur as TELNET tries to insert outgoing data into the Net.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite                                                          [Page 12]\n\f\nRFC 206                      A User TELNET                   August 1971\n\n\n                      Figure 3.
