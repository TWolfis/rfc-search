These\n   Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n   1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as\n      servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis\n      for at least two weeks.  Included here are:\n\n         NETWORK             SITE           COMPUTER\n         ADDRESS\n\n         133                 BBN            PDP-10(B)\n         13                  Case           PDP-10\n         15                  Ames/(Paoli)   ILLIAC/(B6500)\n\n   2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included\n      here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network\n      (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN*).  This category also includes the\n      Network Control Center (Network Address 5) which is used solely\n      for gathering statistics from the Network.  Finally, included\n      among these Hosts are the following:\n\n         NETWORK             SITE           COMPUTER\n         ADDRESS\n\n         7                   Rand           IBM-360/65\n         73                  Harvard        PDP-1\n         12                  Illinois       PDP-11\n         19                  NBS            PDP-11\n\n   NOTE:  During this interval both the UTAH PDP-10 and the RAND PDP-10\n          became Network servers.\n\n   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this\n   period.\n\n   * The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\n   such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to\n   refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\nWestheimer                                                      [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 298                   NETWORK HOST STATUS              February 1972\n\n\nADDRESS  SITE           COMPUTER          DATE AND TIME (EASTERN)\n                                        1/17  1/18  1/19  1/20  1/21\n                                        1800  1730  1000  1500  1730\n\n  1      UCLA(NMC)      SIGMA-7         #H     O    #D     O     O\n 65      UCLA(CCN)      IBM-360/91       O     O    #D     O     O\n  2      SRI(NIC)       PDP-10           O     O     O     O     O\n 66      SRI(AI)        PDP-10           D     D     D     D     D\n  3      UCSB           IBM-360/75       O     O     O     D     O\n  4      UTAH           PDP-10           T     T    #T     O     O\n 69      BBN(10X-A)     PDP-10           O     O     D     O     D\n  6      MIT(Multics)   H-645            O     T     O     D     O\n 70      MIT(DM)        PDP-10           D     D     O     O     D\n 71      RAND           PDP-10           D     D     O     D     D\n  8      SDC            IBM-360/155     #D    #D    #D    #D    #D\n  9      HARVARD        PDP-10           O    #D    O     #D    #D\n 10      LINCOLN LABS   IBM-360/67       D     H     T     H     H\n 74      LINCOLN LABS   TX2             #D    #T    #D     R     O\n 11      STANFORD       PDP-10           D     D     D     D     D\n 14      CARNEGIE       PDP-10           H     H     H     H     H\n 16      AMES           IBM-360/67       D     D     D     D     D\n\n\nADDRESS  SITE           COMPUTER          DATE AND TIME (EASTERN)\n                                        1/24  1/25  1/26  1/27  1/28\n                                        1430  1630  1730  1300  1530\n\n  1      UCLA(NMC)      SIGMA-7          O     O     O     O     T\n 65      UCLA(CCN)      IBM-360/91       O     O     O     O     O\n  2      SRI(NIC)       PDP-10           O     O     T     O     O\n 66      SRI(AI)        PDP-10           D     D     D     D     D\n  3      UCSB           IBM-360/75       O     O     D     O     O\n  4      UTAH           PDP-10           O     O     O     O     O\n 69      BBN(10X-A)     PDP-10           O     D     O     H     O\n  6      MIT(Multics)   H-645            R     O     D     O     D\n 70      MIT(DM)        PDP-10           O     D     T     O     H\n 71      RAND           PDP-10           T     D     D     O     D\n  8      SDC            IBM-360/155     #D    #D    #D    #D    #D\n  9      HARVARD        PDP-10          #R    #R     O     O     O\n 10      LINCOLN LABS   IBM-360/67       H     D     H     T     H\n 74      LINCOLN LABS   TX2              O     O     O     O     T\n 11      STANFORD       PDP-10           D     D     D     D     D\n 14      CARNEGIE       PDP-10           D     H     H     D     H\n 16      AMES           IBM-360/67       D     D     D     D     D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestheimer                                                      [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 298                   NETWORK HOST STATUS              February 1972\n\n\n    where\n\n      D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to\n      network partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal\n      IMP.)\n\n      H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either\n      immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)\n\n      O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible\n      to users.)\n\n      R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)\n\n      T = Timed out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open\n      a connection within 60 second)\n\n      * The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a\n      Network Job Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not\n      equipped to test NETRJS.
