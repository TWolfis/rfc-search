The link chosen was the highest\nunassigned link which was incorrectly calculated to be number 223. The\ncorrect number is 191. Therefore, Link 191 will be assigned for\nmeasurement use. Use of this link should be cleared with the Liasion\nOfficer at the Network Measurement Center (NMC).\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n        [ into the online RFC archives by Thomas Nielsen 4/97 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
