It seems to me\nmost important to gain experience using the network before making\nchanges to the protocol which are not dictated by necessity.  (I\npolled several sites regarding Bill's suggestion.  Sites with NCP\nimplementations under way tended to agree with this policy, while\nsites further behind tended to desire Bill's suggested change.)\n\nWith respect to changes, in general, I believe that changes are\nnecessary to improve the efficiency, provide greater flexibility, and\nguarantee reliability.  Many of us can suggest changes now, but I\nsuspect that clearer ideas will emerge from usage.\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n         [ into the online RFC archives by Josh Elliott 1/98 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
