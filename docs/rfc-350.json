Stoughton\nUser Accounts for UCSB On-line System                     UCSB\nNIC 10549                                                 18-May-72\n\n        For the past year UCSB has provided free use of the UCSB\n        On-line System to Network sites.  Recharges for this\n        service are being paid for by the Computer Research Lab\n        with funds out of our current ARPA contract.  Connect\n        time for the month of April totaled 152 hours.\n\n        Presently, all users are running on the same account:\n        User Number=196, ID Code=57372, User Name=ARPA.  As\n        such, it is difficult to monitor the amount of use by\n        each site.  Consequently, we are changing the login\n        procedure for Network users, effective 1 June 72.\n\n        Commencing June 1, the new login parameters will be:\n\n           User Number=196\n           ID=57372\n           User Name=\u003csite destination\u003e\n           Job Name=\u003cyour name\u003e (NIC ID will suffice).\n\n        The appropriate site designation is listed at the end of\n        this RFC for each affilliation presently connected to\n        the ARPA network.  Any site omitted from this list which\n        plans on running at UCSB should contact me at (805)\n        961-3793.\n\n        Network users of the UCSB On-line System are reminded\n        that these free accounts are provided for Network\n        experimentation.  We also encourage use of this service\n        on a casual basis inorder that users unfamiliar with the\n        Culler-Fried System may acquaint themselves with some of\n        the facilities available.  However, sites intending to\n        use the system on a production basis are requested to\n        open a private account to which computer charges can be\n        billed.\n\n        We will also continue to provide free remote batch\n        support on a limited basis.  Again, this service is\n        provided as a convenience to Network sites who are\n        attempting to implement and debug Network software.\n        Sites submitting production jobs will be expected to\n        open a Computer Center account and pay for computer\n        charges billed to that account.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\n\n\f\nNWG/RFC# 350                                RMS 18-MAY-72 15:38  10549\nUser Accounts for UCSB On-Line System\n\n              Affilliation     Network    Site Designation\n                               Address    (User Name)\n\n              AMES-67          16         AMES\n\n              AMES-ILLIAC      ?
