During this period the MIT Math Lab PDP-10 (Network\naddress 198) became a server.\n\n      No testing was done on June 6 due to an attempt to install the\nnew IMP system.  No testing was done on June 9 as the prototype\nTerminal IMP was being used for software debugging.\n\n      On June 16 the ARPA Terminal IMP (Network 156) was installed in\nArlington, Virginia.\n\n      Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.\nThese Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n1) Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network as\nservers (available for use from other sites) on a regular basis for at\nleast two weeks.  The only Host in this category is the PDP-10 at Case\n(Network address 13).\n\n2) Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included here\nare the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network (AMES,\nMITRE, NBS, ETAC, USC, GWC, NOAA, RADC, SAAC, BELVOIR, ARPA, and\nBBN*).  This category also includes the Network Control Center\ncomputer (Network address 5) which is used solely for gathering\nstatistics from the Network.  Finally, included among these Hosts are\nthe following:\n          Network\n          Address                Site                Computer\n          -------                ----                --------\n              7                 Rand                 IBM-360/65\n             73                 Harvard              PDP-1\n             12                 Illinois             PDP-11\n             19                 NBS                  PDP-11\n             23                 USC                  IBM-360/44\n\n      The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status\nfor this period.\n________________\n*The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as\n such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used\n to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nSTATUS OR\n SITE                                                       PREDICTIONS\nADDRESS   SITE           COMPUTER    STATUS OR PREDICTION   OBTAINED FROM\n-------   ----           --------    --------------------   -------------\n   1      UCLA           SIGMA-7     Server #Limited         Jon Postel\n  65      UCLA           IBM-360/91  NETRJS now              Bob Braden\n                                     (Telnet in June)\n   2      SRI (NIC)      PDP-10      Server                  Jim White\n  66      SRI (AI)       PDP-10      Server                  Len Chaiten\n   3      UCSB           IBM-360/75  Server                  Ron Stoughton\n   4      UTAH           PDP-10      Server                  Barry Wessler\n  *5      BBN (NCC)      DDP-516     Never                   Alex McKenzie\n  69      BBN (TENEX-A)  PDP-10      Server                  Dan Murphy\n 133      BBN (TENEX-B)  PDP-10      Server(Exper.)
