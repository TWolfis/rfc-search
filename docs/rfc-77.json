Postel\nRequest for Comments: 77                                            UCLA\nNIC 5604                                                20 November 1970\n\n                         Network Meeting Report\n\nThis is a report on a series of three Network Working Group meetings at\nthe Fall Joint Computer Conference, November 16, 17 and 18 in Houston,\nTexas.  The meeting will be lumped together and ideas may or may not be\nidentified as to their originator.  The meetings were chaired by Steve\nCrocker.\n\nThe meetings began with a listing of topics of concern.\n\n1) A site or group should be designated as protocol testers.  As NCP's\n   are implemented they should be subjected to comprehensive testing by\n   an independent group.\n\n2) The Host-Host protocol needs reworking in several areas: error\n   control, overload conditions, allocation of resources, status\n   information, and system crash problems.\n\n3) The immediate need for specification of TELNET, the third level\n   program which allows people to pass through their local hosts and use\n   remote hosts.  TELNET must provide facilities to log in at a distant\n   site, run programs, transmit files, and call for help.  This call for\n   help is likely to mean getting a systems programmer at the remote\n   site \"taking control\" of the user console.\n\n4) The documentation of systems on the network must become available to\n   all sites.  This is to be done by the NIC with the cooperation of the\n   other sites.  Particularly useful will be on-line documentation.  It\n   is suggested that each site have an identical hard copy device (e.g.\n   a line printer) suitable for reproducing documents.\n\n5) The use of graphics consoles on the network will require a graphics\n   protocol.  People interested in this problem should write position\n   papers on such a protocol.  A meeting may be held between the authors\n   of such papers if sufficient interest develops.  The papers should be\n   distributed as NWG/RFC's before 1 January 71.\n\n6) Some sites must account for use of their computer resources, thus\n   there must be some network accounting scheme.  Sites can be\n   categorized as Research Centers vs. Service Centers.  The Service\n   centers tend to have big machines, lots of users, and accounting\n   problems; while the Research Centers tend to have specialized\n   hardware, a small number of users, and no accounting at all.\n\n\n\n\nJ. Postel                                                       [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 77                   Network Meeting Report         20 November 1970\n\n\n7) Some people are interested in the network as an object of study.  In\n   particular UCLA-Computer Science, and BBN wish to perform\n   measurements on the network.  Is it appropriate to ask the NCP to\n   keep statistics?\n\nAfter this opening some discussion followed.\n\nIt was generally felt that changes to the protocol should be made in\nbunches and at about six-month intervals rather than a continuous stream\nof small changes.  Also that a lead time of three months was not over\noptimistic.  The proposed change to the IMP-Host protocol to get rid of\nmarking was generally approved but it will not be implemented for some\ntime since casual changes to the protocol are undesirable.  Tom\nO'Sullivan suggested that perhaps new and old protocols could work\ntogether, that is the new protocol would support the old one as well as\nprovide better mechanisms where possible.  Steve Crocker suggested that\na new protocol might be developed as a private experimental protocol\nbetween two or three sites.\n\nIt was stressed that it is necessary that the network be used to gain\nexperience, and that we should get teletype-like console use of remote\nsystems going before we get too involved in graphics.  Perhaps the\ngraphics protocol should be developed by a different set of people.  The\nscheduling of a graphics protocol meeting was thus discouraged, but\npapers should still be written.  Strong feelings were expressed in\nfavour of first developing use of remote subsystems and file\ntransmission instead of worrying about graphics at this stage.  It was\nsuggested that development of protocols at the higher levels be driven\nby applications.\n\nDocumentation will be a major concern for network users.  Several people\nmentioned that users at their sites have already begun to inquire about\nthe network.  As Eric Harslem put it \"What does the ARPA Network have to\noffer?\"  Some sites (Multics, SRI) keep system documentation on-line.\nIt was suggested that the trillion bit store be used to keep on-line\ndocumentation of all systems.\n\nAt this point Doug Engelbart gave a presentation on the Network\nInformation Center (NIC).  The goals or services of NIC have not been\nwell defined by anyone and have been left up to NIC to define.  NIC has\ndecided that one urgent task is to make information about the network\nand the host systems on the network available to users of the network.\nDoug has found that some people feel threatened by the revelation of\ntheir documentation inadequacy.  Doug's project at SRI has built up a\nsystem that allows the user to create catalogs and indices into a\ncollection of information.  The system has a master catalog of all\ninformation files.  Each user may have a number of private (or shared)\ncatalogs.  The system provides a means of examining on-line the catalogs\n\n\n\nJ. Postel                                                       [Page 2]\n\f\nRFC 77                   Network Meeting Report         20 November 1970\n\n\nand amending them.  The system also provides a means to examine any\ninformation file which happens to be on-line and for creating new\ninformation files on-line.\n\nSeveral problems will delay the NIC from coming on the network.  One of\nthese is the switch from the XDS-940 to the PDP-10 (TENEX).  The switch\nis being made because the 940 system is inadequate to handle the\nanticipated load.  At first it was planned to offer service on the 940\nand switch to the 10 when it came up, but too much effort would be\nrequired for a very small payoff.\n\nDoug explained the working of the Network Dialoge System.  At each site\nthere is a communication agent and a technical liaison officer.  The\nagents will be trained by NIC to use the facilities of NIC to get\ninformation about the Network and other sites.  The agents will acquire\nfrom NIC documents of interest to users at the local site, be able to\ncontact NIC at a toll free number, and should have an on-line console\ninto the network (and therefore NIC).  Thus the Network Dialoge System\nis a network of people (the agents).\n\nSteve Crocker then brought us up to date on the status of the network.\nHe drew a picture of what is connected and what is proposed.  He\ndiscussed the level of implementation at various sites.  Eric Harslem\nmentioned that RAND and UCSB had conducted tests of their NCP\nimplementations last week (10 Nov 70) and that things worked well.\n\nFrank Heart announced that BBN was planning the development of a\n\"Terminal\" IMP.  The Terminal IMP would support some large number of a\nwide range of consoles as well as provide the normal IMP functions.\n\nAt this point we broke and scheduled to reconvene Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Tuesday meeting started with Doug giving another pass at explaining\nthe SRI system at a more detailed level.  The basic thing to deal with\nis the collection.  The user can query over the collection or over sub\ncollections.  The user can obtain bibliographic references of three\nkinds: a) full references, b) first line, c) author indexed.\nInformation files of the collection may be on-line, in tape libraries,\nor only in hard copy.  It is suggested that much data could be kept at\nother network sites, for example the trillion bit store and before that\nperhaps on disk at UCSB.  If files are kept at other sites then the\nsystem must be able to retrieve them automatically when they are\nrequested.  The subsystem to be used is called TODAS.  TODAS is an\nevolving program and the documentation of TODAS is inadequate.  In\nTODAS, file are organized hierarchically, each paragraph is numbered,\nand it is possible to do context analysis on the text.\n\n\n\n\n\nJ. Postel                                                       [Page 3]\n\f\nRFC 77                   Network Meeting Report         20 November 1970\n\n\nDoug then mentioned some things about the console interaction.  This\nraised a question about half vs. full duplex and line oriented vs.\ncharacter oriented systems.  The remainder of the meeting revolved\naround this issue.\n\nI shall try to define the terms as I understand them for purpose of\nclarity in the following.  Half duplex is the situation where the\nconsole, a peripheral processor or some very low level software, echos\nthe character entered.  The console can not be used to input data while\noutput is in progress.  Full duplex is the situation where the character\ntyped is echoed by software, and input can be done at the same time as\noutput.  In line oriented systems the user enters a complete line\nterminated by an extra sensitive and of line character (e.g. carriage\nreturn).  Often the keyboard is then locked until after the next output.\nIn character oriented systems each character the user enters is\ninterpreted by software before it is echoed and the echo may be\ndifferent from the character entered.  In particular after a few\ncharacter the software may guess what the user wants and complete the\nline for him.  The following chart will be used for clarity.\n\n\n              | Half Duplex |  Full Duplex\n______________|_____________|_____________\n              |             |\nCharacter     |             |\n   Oriented   |   type1     |    type2\n              |             |\n______________|_____________|_____________\n              |             |\nLine          |             |\n  Oriented    |   type3     |    type4\n              |             |\n______________|_____________|_____________\n\n\n\nIt was discovered that many people don't really know where their own\nsystems fit in this chart and are very vague about what it means to\ninteract with a system in a different than their own.  Doug stated that\nNIC has a system of type 2 but would try to provide service to all types\nof systems.  The following table shows systems with their interaction\ntype and categorization as to Research vs. Service Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ. Postel                                                       [Page 4]\n\f\nRFC 77                   Network Meeting Report         20 November 1970\n\n\nSystem                     Interaction Type           Categorization\n\nUCLA - Sigma-7             2 - char, full             Research\n\nUCLA - 360/91              3 - line, half             Service\n\nMIT - Multics              3 - line, half             Service\n\nSDC                        3 - line, half                ?\n\nRAND                       3 or 4 - line, ?              ?\n\nSRI                        2 - char, full                ?\n\n\nAl Vezza promised to study this problem and to circulate his results as\nan NWG/RFC.  It was pointed out that line oriented systems usually allow\nline editing of the form \"delete last character\" (back space) and\n\"delete line\", however this feature does not alter their classification\nas to interaction type.  Concern arose over what do line oriented\nsystems expect to receive from the network for a connection acting as\nconsole input to a subsystem.  Steve Crocker made the suggestion that\nwhen using a line oriented system transmission be in lines.  More\nprecisely that transmission be in strings of the following form.\n\n                       n c1 c2 ...cn\n\nwhere 1 \u003c= n \u003c= 120   (n is eight bits)\n\nand if ci is an \"end of line\" character then i = n\n\nThis suggestion was not immediately accepted and some discussion took\nplace regarding the significance of Host-Imp-Host message boundaries.\nDoug brought up file transmission and the problem of finding the end of\nthe file, which provoked more discussion.  At this point the meeting\nbroke up with a third session scheduled for 8:00 p.m. Wednesday evening.\n\nThe Wednesday meeting began with the suggestion that at future xJCC's\nthere be an official ARPA Network hotel with a block of rooms on one\nfloor and a nearby meeting room for networkers.  This suggestion was\nfavored by all.\n\nSteve Crocker asked how people felt about these meetings.  The general\nfeeling was that the meetings were very useful and should occur about 3\nmonths apart.  Al Vezza pointed out that meetings this size (15 - 30\npeople) are good for bringing up problems but not for putting them down.\nSteve proposed that 3 or 4 people be designated to solve particular\nproblems.  Al responded that 3 people can't legislate.  That any such\n\n\n\nJ. Postel                                                       [Page 5]\n\f\nRFC 77                   Network Meeting Report         20 November 1970\n\n\nsolution must be considered in the same way as a proposal by an\nindividual.\n\nSteve persuaded Peggy Karp to act as NWG/RFC editor.  This is a job\nindependent of cataloging RFC's or assigning numbers (functions now\nperformed by NIC).  The RFC editor will only categorize RFC as \"hot\nissues\", current, out of date, or superseded.\n\nThe subject of Logger protocol -- that is, how to get the first\nconnection -- needs to be officially defined.  NWG/RFC #66 suggests one\nway.  Eric Harslem will revise this and send it out as proposed official\nprotocol.  Ed Myer will also send out a proposal.\n\nSteve then opened up discussion of the topics of the previous meeting by\nsuggesting we talk about the following: Message boundaries, half duplex\nvs.  ull duplex, line oriented vs. character oriented, file\ntransmission, byte counts in messages, byte sizes and transactional\nunits.  It was proposed that transactions on the command link (i.e.\nbetween NCP's) be always in multiples of eight bits.  This mean that the\nlength field in the ECO, ERP, and ERR commands will always have three\nlow order zeroes.  This was approved.  Steve then proposed that\nconnections could be established with a declared byte size and a maximum\nrecord length in bytes.  Transactional units on this type of connection\nwould be of the form\n\n                  n c1 c2 c3 ... cn\n\nwhere 0 \u003c= n \u003c= max record length\n\nif n = 0 then the transactional unit acts like a semaphore.  Steve\nsuggested that we should look into the theory of information exchange,\nparticularly along the lines of Richard Kaline (NWG/RFC #60).  Perhaps\nfor each information unit sent there should be some status response.\n\nThe next question was on file transmission.  In particular, how do you\nfind the end?  Frank Heart suggested that with each portion there be a\nflag indicating \"this is not the end\" until in the last portion the flag\nis switched to indicate \"this is the end\".  Eric Harslem suggested that\neach portion should have an \"opcode\" field, a length field, and the text\nwhich is length bits (bytes?) long.  This appears to be like the data\ntypes proposed at the Lincoln Lab meeting last spring.  Ed Myer proposed\nthat two connections be used, one for the file transmission and the\nother to control it.  The file control connection would specify the data\nconnection and indicate that transmission as about to start.  After the\nsender had completed the file transmission he would send on the file\ncontrol link the total number of bits sent.  The receiver would then\nknow how many bits to receive and exactly where the end of the file\nshould be.  Bob Metcalfe was concerned that some of the proposals mixed\n\n\n\nJ. Postel                                                       [Page 6]\n\f\nRFC 77                   Network Meeting Report         20 November 1970\n\n\ncontrol information with data and felt that perhaps this mixing should\nbe avoided.\n\nSteve asked if anybody could suggest an advisor we might talk about\nthese problems.  Bob Metcalfe suggested Anatol Holt.  Bob Sundberg\nsuggested George Mealy.  Eric Harslem and Peggy Karp suggested that\npeople who worked on the COIN System might be helpful.  Frank Heart\nsuggested that no one has solved these problems.\n\nSteve proposed that Service Centers offer line oriented interaction with\nno echoing of the input.  Any simple editing (e.g. back space) would be\ndone at the using site.  Ed Meyer suggested that there be official\nprotocols for both line oriented and character oriented interaction.\nSteve promised to write a NWG/RFC clarifying the issues and laying out\nthe arguments on full transactions, byte counts, and accumulating data\non the receive side.\n\nIt was felt that these were hard problems that needed more thought.\nThus the meeting was adjourned with the request that people circulate\nany ideas or proposals as NWG/RFC's.  Ed Myer took notes and agreed to\nalso prepare a NWG/RFC summarizing these meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ.
