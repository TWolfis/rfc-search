I\n   believe that the work on protocols (1st, 2nd, and 3rd level) and file\n   transmission procedures are highly relevant.  NWG participants should\n   welcome the opportunity to inject their ideas into the published\n   literature.  Many NWG/RFC's already are in good enough shape for\n   publication so don't hesitate to submit your drafts.  Time is short,\n   so prompt action is essential.\n\n   ACM IEEE\n\n                              CALL FOR PAPERS\n             SECOND SYMPOSIUM ON PROBLEMS IN THE OPTIMIZATION\n                       OF DATA COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS\n\n   SIGCOMM of ACM and the Technical Committee on Commuter Communications\n   of the IEEE Commuter Society are sponsoring the Second Symposium on\n   Problems in the Optimization of Data Communication Systems to be held\n   at Stanford University on October 20-22, 1971.  The symposium will\n   include the presentation of papers, panel discussions, and workshop\n   sessions.  The purpose is to bring together people engaged in\n   computer communication system design, analysis, and research.  The\n   setting will be one where each participant can engage in a dialogue\n   on problems of interest to him with his colleagues in the computer/\n   communications professional community.\n\nPapers are being sought in the following areas:\n\n   Advances in Data Communication Networks\n   Computer Communication Technology\n   New Applications and Applications Models\n   Software Organization for Communications\n   Systems Modeling, Evaluation, Optimization\n   Interface Problems and Standards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCerf                                                            [Page 1]\n\f\nRFC 157            Invitation to the Second Symposium        12 May 1971\n\n\nFull drafts:\n\n   *may not exceed 5000 words\n   *must include an informative abstract\n   Detailed information will be supplied later concerning\n   the find copy of accepted papers.\n\n   Papers should be mailed to\n\n   V.
