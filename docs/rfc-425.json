A not insignificant \nportion of this use turns out to be random prodding and poking of one system\nby another.  An example of this is the \"Survey\" mechanism that many sites are\nconstructing to see \"who's up.\"  Several systems have noted that this one\nmechanism alone accounts for a log of their overhead, and is not chargeable to\nany given user.\n\nIn response to this particular problem, MIT-DMCG and UCLA-NMC, who have both\nbeen doing surveys for some time, have agreed upon a standard format for host\nsurvey data and will make it available to the network community.  They will be\njoined by a third site, and will provide a standard socket to obtain this\ninformation.  The data will be a concise character stream so as to be both\nhuman and machine readable.\n\nThe exact format of the data and the socket number will be forthcoming.\n\nThe intent of all this is for all other sites to stop surveying on their own\nand get this data from one of the participating \"Official Surveyors\" either\nprompted by a user's request or on a periodic basis, whatever they wish.\n\nThis should, itself, help considerably to eliminate a lot of the network\n'noise factor.'  But, in addition, we should all try to be more aware of the\ncost of this type of traffic and try to avoid repeated interactions with a\ngiven Host without some expressed consent - be it an account number of some\nspecific experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBB/ph\n"
