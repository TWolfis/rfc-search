RFC 399\nis restated here, followed by a description of the nature of the\nresponse elicted by these commands\n\n       Two new commands have been added to UCSB's Simple Minded\nFile System (SMFS).  They are described below.\n\n       Login (LGI)\n       The Login command is the means whereby the user identifies\nhimself and specifies the account number to which his use of SMFS\nis to be billed.  The user should issue a LGI command directly\nafter completing the ICP and before any command referencing a\nfile.  The user name and account number specified remain in\neffect until another LGI command is issued, a LGO command is\nissued, or the connection is close.\n\n       At present, the use of SMFS is not billed, and therefore\nuse of the accounting command is optional.  It is requested,\nhowever, that users and user processes begin to use this command\nas soon as possible, since we would like to collect statistics on\nSMFS utilization before implementing billing.  Therefore, at\npresent the user name can be any name that identifies the user,\nand the account number is completely arbitrary.\n\n       The format of the LGI command is given below.  Note that\nthe lengths of the fixed-length fields are given in bits.  The op\ncode for LGI is decimal 13.\n\n           8\n       \u003cop code\u003e\u003cuser name\u003e\u003caccount number\u003e\n\nThe \u003cuser name\u003e and \u003caccount number\u003e fields are further divided\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nNWG/RFC #431                           MCK 15-DEC-72 12:39  13300\nUpdate on SMFS Login and Logout\n\nas follows:\n\n          8     8*length\n      \u003clength\u003e\u003cuser name\u003e\n\nWhere \u003clength\u003e gives the length in 8-bit characters of the \u003cuser\nname\u003e or \u003caccount number\u003e subfield.  The maximum length of \u003cuser\nname\u003e is eight characters and of \u003caccount number\u003e is four\ncharacters.  The \u003cuser name\u003e and \u003caccount number\u003e fields must\nconsist of characters chosen from the same character set as\nfilenames.\n\n        Logout (LGO)\n       The logout command terminates the association between the\nuser and the accounting information specified in the last LGI\ncommand issued, if any; it does not cause SMFS to close the\nconnection.  The user should then issue another LGI command\nbefore attempting any operation referencing a file. It is not\nnecessary to issue a LGO command before issuing another LGI\ncommand, or before closing the connection.\n\n       Again, at the present time the LGO command is optional,\nand does not affect the user's ability to reference files.\n\n       The format of the LGO command is as follows:\n\n           8\n       \u003cop code\u003e\n\nThe op code for LGO is decimal 14.\n\n        Login and logout each elicit, as their only response, an\neight-bit completion code.  Like the other SMFS commands, the\ncompletion code is equal to the command's op code if the command\nwas successful.  The following error completion codes, given in\ndecimal, are currently defined:\n\n\n       47      The length of \u003cuser name\u003e is zero.\n       48      \u003cuser name\u003e is too long.\n       49      \u003cuser name\u003e contains invalid characters.\n       50      The length of \u003caccount number\u003e is zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 2]\n\f\nNWG/RFC# 431                           MCK 15-DEC-72 12:39 13300\nUpdate on SMFS Login and Logout\n\n\n       51      \u003caccount number\u003e is too long.\n       52      \u003caccount number\u003e contains invalid characters.\n       53      \u003cuser name) specifies an invalid user.\n       54      \u003caccount number\u003e specifies an invalid account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n       [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n       [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                      1/97 ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 3]\n\f\n"
