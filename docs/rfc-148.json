For example, in our PDP-10 (DMCG-\nITS) NCP, we have at present no way of sending or receiving\nexactly 32-bits of data. Data is transmitted either in\nimage mode (36-bit bytes) or in ASCII mode (8-bit characters\nwith the 8th bit as zero). Perhaps we should permit the\nserver to send more than 32-bits (say 72-bits) where the\nremaining bits could be NULL fillers. The byte size\n's' for the connection may be fixed at 8-bits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [ This RFC was put into machine readable form for entry ]\n  [ into the online RFC archives by BBN Corp. under the   ]\n  [ direction of Alex McKenzie.                   12/96   ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\n"
