For example Loggers (telnet servers)\nListen on socket 1. What sockets at your host are Listened to by what\nprograms?\n\n   Recently Dick Watson suggested assigning socket 5 for use by a\nmail-box protocol (RFC196). Does any one object ? Are there any\nsuggestions for a method of assigning sockets to standard programs?\nShould a subset of the socket numbers be reserved for use by future\nstandard protocols?\n\n   Please phone or mail your answers and commtents to:\n\n                        Jon Postel\n                        The SPADE Group\n                        3732 Boelter Hall\n                        Computer Science Dept.\n                        ULA, LA.
