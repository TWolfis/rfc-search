On November 18, however, the BBN prototype Terminal\nIMP (Network Address 158) was inaccessible due to hardware debugging.\n\n      Several Hosts are  currently  excluded  fron  the  daily  testing.\nThese Hosts fall into two categories:\n\n      1)  Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on\n          the Network as servers (available for use from\n          other sites) for at least two weeks.  Included here\n          are:\n\n          Network\n          Address        Site             Computer\n\n            71           Rand             PDP-10\n            74           Lincoln          TX2\n            13           Case             PDP-10\n            14           Carnegie         PDP-10\n            15           Ames             B6500\n            16           Ames             IBM-360/67\n\n      2)  Hosts which are curently intended to be users only.\n          Included here are the Terminal IMPs, which are\n          presently in the Network (AMES, MITRE, and BBN*).\n          This category also includes the Network Control\n          Center Computer (Network Address 5) which is used\n          solely for gathering statistics from the Network.\n          Finally, included among these Hosts are the following:\n\n          Network\n          Address        Site             Computer\n\n             7           Rand             IBM-360/65\n            73           Harvard          PDP-1\n            12           Illinois         PDP-11\n\n      During these two weeks the Lincoln Labs TX2 Hosts became a Network\nUser.  The SDC IBM 360/67 is now a server.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                [Page 1]\n\f\nThe tables on the next two pages summarize the information on Host\nstatus for this period.\n\n* The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and\nas such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being\nused to refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.\n\nNETWORK                            STATUS or            STATUS or\nADDRESS    SITE        COMPUTER    PREDUCTION           PREDUCTION\n
